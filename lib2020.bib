abstract = {It is required to construct a more general constitutive equation for soils in order to analyze three-dimensional boundary-value problems in the field of soil mechanics. Since soils are regarded as work-hardening and rate sensitive materials with dilatancy, the equation must be the one which can describe the soil behaviors due to those properties. So far the researches concerned with the constitutive equation of soils may be divided into two categories, i. e., (i) the deformation characteristics at the equilibrium state and (ii) the rate sensitive properties. The objective of this study is to construct a more general and realistic constitutive equation for fully saturated normally-consolidated clays by unifying the results of above two major approaches. Namely, Roscoe’s critical state energy theory for clays is extended so that it explains the rate sensitive property by using Perzyna’s theory of elasto/viscoplastic continuum and some empirical evidences. It can be concluded that the proposed constitutive equation can more generally describe the behaviors of clays such as creep, stress relaxation and constant strain rate shear processes than those by other investigators, although there remains a work to refine the equation. The equation is expressed in terms of the second order tensor field. Thus, one can apply it to three dimentional problems by means of the finite element method.}

abstract = {Abstract Landslides or questions related to slope stability are usually considered in the framework of plastic limit analyses. Recent progress has made it possible to describe some failure modes in the framework of the theories of bifurcation of the strain mode by plastic strain localization and the shear-banding phenomenon. We propose in this paper to reconsider the question of landslide analysis by taking into account an appropriate instability criterion. As soils are strongly non-associated materials, unstable states can be reached strictly inside the plastic limit condition (which defines the set of admissible stresses). In the first part of this paper, we describe the constitutive model. Then Lyapunov's definition of stability allows us to detect unstable stress–strain states from experimental evidence. These unstable states are analysed by considering the sign of the second-order work. The stability analysis, performed for loose and dense sands under plane strain conditions, shows a large domain of instabilities in the stress space. This method is applied to some boundary-value problems by finite elements computations. It is shown finally by examples that such unstable stress–strain states are observed in our FEM modelling of slope problems. Copyright © 2000 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, a continuum-based shape design sensitivity formulation is presented for a hyper-elastic structure with multibody frictional contact. A nearly incompressible constraints is treated using the pressure projection method that projects a hydrostatic pressure into a lower order space to avoid a volumetric locking. The variational formulation for multibody frictional contact is developed using a penalty method that regularizes the solution of the variational inequality. The material derivative of continuum mechanics is utilized to develop the continuum-based shape design sensitivity analysis for the hyper-elastic constitutive relation and penalized contact formulation. The sensitivity equation is solved at each converged load step using the same tangent stiffness of response analysis due to the path dependency of the sensitivity of the frictional contact problem. A very accurate and efficient sensitivity results are shown through shape optimization of a windshield wiper.},

	Abstract = {Numerical integration errors and volumetric locking in the near-incompressible limit are two outstanding issues in Galerkin-based meshfree computations. In this paper, we present a modified Gaussian integration scheme on background cells for meshfree methods that alleviates errors in numerical integration and ensures patch test satisfaction to machine precision. Secondly, a locking-free small-strain elasticity formulation for meshfree methods is proposed, which draws on developments in assumed strain methods and nodal integration techniques. In this study, maximum-entropy basis functions are used; however, the generality of our approach permits the use of any meshfree approximation. Various benchmark problems in two-dimensional compressible and near-incompressible small strain elasticity are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and optimal convergence in the energy norm of the maximum-entropy meshfree formulation. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Huang2004,
	Abstract = {The solution of problems in which coupling occurs between the displacement of the soil skeleton and the pore fluid pressure is fundamental in soil dynamics. The formulation requires that the interpolation functions for the displacement and pressure in the finite element discretization must satisfy the so-called Babuska--Brezzi stability criteria or the patch test in the limit of nearly incompressible pore fluid and small permeability. The criteria are not fulfiled by elements with the same order of interpolation for both variables unless stabilization techniques are introduced. This paper summarizes the stabilization techniques that have been proposed in the literature to overcome volumetric locking for the incompressible or nearly incompressible soil dynamic behaviours. In particular, the staggered implicit--implicit algorithm (i.e. the fractional step method in an implicit form) and the direct -method proposed by the first author and Zienkiewicz et al. are briefly reviewed. Attentions will be paid to the steady-state formulations resulted from both approaches. Based on the steady state formulations, the paper will then discuss the determination of the local stabilization parameters, with which a significant improvement for the obtained solutions of pore-pressure can be achieved. Further discussion on the limitations of the methods is also given. Finally, several numerical examples are presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed techniques.

	Abstract = {Previous experimental studies of convection in fluids with temperature-dependent viscosity reached viscosity contrasts of the order of 105. Although this value seems large, it still might not be large enough for understanding convection in the interiors of Earth and other planets whose viscosity is a much stronger function of temperature. The reason is that, according to theory, above 104-105 viscosity contrasts, convection must undergo a major transition-to stagnant lid convection. This is an asymptotic regime in which a stagnant lid is formed on the top of the layer and convection is driven by the intrinsic, rheological, temperature scale, rather than by the entire temperature drop in the layer. A finite element multigrid scheme appropriate for large viscosity variations is employed and convection with up to 1014 viscosity contrasts has been systematically investigated in a 2D square cell with free-slip boundaries. We reached the asymptotic regime in the limit of large viscosity contrasts and obtained scaling relations which are found to be in good agreement with theoretical predictions. 1995 American Institute of Physics.},

	Abstract = {Avalanches, debris flows, and landslides are geophysical hazards, which involve rapid mass movement of granular solids, water and air as a single-phase system. The dynamics of a granular flow involve at least three distinct scales: the micro-scale, meso-scale, and the macro-scale. This study aims to understand the ability of continuum models to capture the micro-mechanics of dry granular collapse. Material Point Method (MPM), a hybrid Lagrangian and Eulerian approach, with Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion is used to describe the continuum behaviour of granular column collapse, while the micromechanics is captured using Discrete Element Method (DEM) with tangential contact force model. The run-out profile predicted by the continuum simulations matches with DEM simulations for columns with small aspect ratios ('h/r' {\textless} 2), however MPM predicts larger run-out distances for columns with higher aspect ratios ('h/r' {\textgreater} 2). Energy evolution studies in DEM simulations reveal higher collisional dissipation in the initial free-fall regime for tall columns. The lack of a collisional energy dissipation mechanism in MPM simulations results in larger run-out distances. Micro-structural effects, such as shear band formations, were observed both in DEM and MPM simulations. A sliding flow regime is observed above the distinct passive zone at the core of the column. Velocity profiles obtained from both the scales are compared to understand the reason for a slow flow run-out mobilization in MPM simulations. {\textcopyright} 2013 AIP Publishing LLC.},

This paper revisits a well known case study of an embankment of Boston Blue Clay, which was thoroughly instrumented and measured with piezometers, settlement rods and inclinometers over a long time period during and after construction. The soil parameters were very comprehensively collected by both in situ and laboratory tests in several major test programs. The behaviour of the ground considering the modified Cam-Clay model including and excluding soil creep is simulated using finite element method. The analysed data are verified with field measurements and a parametric study is conducted to evaluate the influence of creep index on excess pore water pressures generated and the displacement of the ground under the embankment. It is observed that both horizontal displacements and excess pore water pressures of the ground under the embankment increased by the creep index. Thus effects of soil creep should be precisely considered in predicting the ground performance under embankments.},

The second is to provide numerical stability$\backslash$nby scaling the contact impulse when computational grid in- formation$\backslash$nis suspect, a condition which can be expected to occur occasionally$\backslash$nas material bodies move through the computational grid. The modifications$\backslash$ndescribed preserve important properties of the original algorithm,$\backslash$nnamely conservation of momentum, and the use of global quantities$\backslash$nwhich obviate the need for neighbor searches and result in the computational$\backslash$ncost scaling linearly with the number of contacting bodies.

	Abstract = {This paper presents a three-dimensional elastic viscoplastic constitutive model that is able to reproduce the time dependent behaviour of soils with isotach viscosity. This constitutive law is based on the overstress theory and incorporates some important features, namely: (i) a non-linear creep law with a limit for the amount of creep deformation under isotropic stress conditions; (ii) a flexible loading surface that is capable of reproducing a wide range of shapes in p' - J stress space and incorporates the Matsuoka-Nakai failure criterion in the deviatoric stress space and (iii) assumes that the viscoplastic scalar multiplier is constant on a given loading surface to ensure that critical state conditions are reached. A full description of the model, its governing equations and implementation in a finite element program are presented. The model is then used to simulate the results of laboratory tests, highlighting the model's abilities and shortcomings in reproducing the time dependent behaviour of soft clays. Furthermore, the paper investigates the importance of accounting for creep non-linearity and the consequences of isotach viscosity on the critical state line. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {A monolithic coupling between the material point method (MPM) and the finite element method (FEM) is presented. The MPM formulation described is implicit, and the exchange of information between particles and background grid is minimized. The reduced information transfer from the particles to the grid improves the stability of the method. Once the residual is assembled, the system matrix is obtained by means of automatic differentiation. In such a way, no explicit computation is required and the implementation is considerably simplified. When MPM is coupled with FEM, the MPM background grid is attached to the FEM body and the coupling is monolithic. With this strategy, no MPM particle can penetrate a FEM element, and the need for computationally expensive contact search algorithms used by existing coupling procedures is eliminated. The coupled system can be assembled with a single assembly procedure carried out element by element in a FEM fashion. Numerical results are reported to display the performances and advantages of the methods here discussed.},

	Abstract = {We introduce an improved meshfree approximation scheme which is based on the local maximum-entropy strategy as a compromise between shape function locality and entropy in an information-theoretical sense. The improved version is specifically designed for severe, finite deformation and offers significantly enhanced stability as opposed to the original formulation. This is achieved by (i) formulating the quasistatic mechanical boundary value problem in a suitable updated-Lagrangian setting, (ii) introducing anisotropy in the shape function support to accommodate directional variations in nodal spacing with increasing deformation and eliminate tensile instability, (iii) spatially bounding and evolving shape function support to restrict the domain of influence and increase efficiency, (iv) truncating shape functions at interfaces in order to stably represent multi-component systems like composites or polycrystals. The new scheme is applied to benchmark problems of severe elastic and elastoplastic deformation that demonstrate its performance both in terms of accuracy (as compared to exact solutions and, where applicable, finite element simulations) and efficiency. Importantly, the presented formulation overcomes the classical tensile instability found in most meshfree interpolation schemes, as shown for stable simulations of, e.g., the inhomogeneous extension of a hyperelastic block up to 100{\%} or the torsion of a hyperelastic cube by 200$\,^{\circ}$ --- both in an updated Lagrangian setting and without the need for remeshing.},

	Abstract = {The Finite Element Method (FEM) has become the stan-dard tool for the analysis of a wide range of solid mechanics problems. However, the underlying structure of a classical updated Lagrangian FEM is not well suited for the treatment of large deformation problems, since excessive mesh distortions can lead to numerical difficulties. The Material Point Method (MPM) represents an approach in which material points moving through a fixed finite element grid are used to simulate large de-formations. As the method makes use of moving material points, it can also be classified as a point-based or meshless method. With no mesh distortions, it is an ideal tool for the analysis of large deformation prob-lems. MPM has its origin in fluid mechanics and has only recently been applied to solid mechanics problems. It has been used successfully for im-pact analyses where bodies penetrate each other and for silo discharging problems. All existing MPM codes found in literature are dynamic codes with explicit time integration and only recently implicit time integra-tion. In this study a quasi-static MPM formulation and implementation are presented. The paper starts with the description of the quasi-static governing equations and the numerical discretisation. Afterwards, the calculation process of the quasi-static MPM is explained, followed by the presentation of some geotechnical boundary value problems which have been solved with the newly developed quasi-static MPM code. The bench-mark problems consist of an oedometer test and a slope. For validation, the results are compared with analytical solutions and FEM results, re-spectively.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents the recent results of an experimental program aimed at disclosing the loading rate (loading-point-displacement rate) effect on the crack velocity in high-strength concrete (HSC). Eighteen three-point-bend tests were conducted using either a servo-hydraulic machine or a self-designed drop-weight impact device. Four strain gauges mounted along the ligament of the specimen were used to measure the crack velocity. Six different loading rates were applied, from 10-4 mm/s to 103 mm/s (average strain rate from 10-6 to 10-1 s-1), i.e., a low loading-rate range (5.50 × 10-4 mm/s, 0.55 mm/s and 17.4 mm/s) and a high loading-rate range (8.81 × 102 mm/s, 1.76 × 103 mm/s and 2.64 × 103 mm/s). At low loading rates, the crack propagates with increasing velocity. Under high loading rates, the crack propagates with slightly decreasing velocity, though the maximum crack speed reached up to 20.6{\%} of the Rayleigh wave speed of the tested HSC. In addition, the loading-rate effect on crack velocities is pronounced within the low loading-rate regime, whereas it is minor under the high loading-rate range. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {This paper focuses on constitutive and numerical modeling of strain-rate dependency in natural clays while also accounting for anisotropy and destructuration. For this purpose the SANICLAY model that accounts for the fabric anisotropy with the additional destructuration feature that accounts for sensitivity of natural clays, is considered as the reference model. An associated flow rule is adopted for simplicity. The model formulation is refined to also account for the important feature of strain-rate dependency using the Perzyna's overstress theory. The model is then implicitly integrated in finite element program PLAXIS. Performance of the developed and implemented model is explored by comparing the simulation results of several element tests and a boundary value problem to the available experimental data. The element tests include the constant strain-rate under one-dimensional and triaxial conditions on different clays. The boundary value problem includes a test embankment, namely embankment D constructed at Saint Alban, Quebec. For comparison, the test embankment is also analyzed using the Modified Cam-Clay (MCC) model, the SANICLAY model, and the viscoplastic model but without destructuration. Results demonstrate the success of the developed and implemented viscoplastic SANICLAY in reproducing the strain-rate dependent behavior of natural soft soils.},

	Abstract = {The free energy of an amorphous, cross-linked polymer is postulated to be expressible as F=F†(T, V)+Fe1(T, $\lambda$), where F† symbolizes the liquid-like contribution from interchain interactions, and F e1 is the elastic contribution attributable to the network structure. The former term is considered to depend only on T and V, and not otherwise on the strain specified by the displacement gradient tensor $\lambda$; F e1 is formulated from the theory of rubber elasticity. The general relationship of stress to strain is derived from F; the temperature coefficient of the logarithm of the measured stress at constant pressure p and distortion $\alpha$=|$\lambda$|-1/3$\lambda$ is shown to differ from that at constant V and $\alpha$ by the linear thermal expansion coefficient of the undistorted polymer; this result holds for any type of strain, provided merely that one (at least) of the normal stresses equates to the constant external pressure. General thermodynamic equations relating the several temperature coefficients of the tension f for constant V and L, for constant p and L, and for constant p and $\alpha$ (extension ratio for fixed volume V) are presented. Expressed as ∂ 1n(f/T)/∂T for the several choices of independent variables indicated, these equations involve the bulk compressibility, the bulk thermal expansion coefficient, and either the coefficient of dilation on stretching or the coefficient of anisotropy of compressibility. Equations of state p(V, T, $\alpha$) and f(V, T, $\alpha$) derived using rubber elasticity theory for formulation of Fe1 afford a basis for evaluating these coefficients. Results depart markedly from those inferred from the theory of infinitesimal deformations. A general basis for interpretation of thermoelastic measurements on high elastic materials is provided. Errors arising from use of previous methods are cited.},

This method was used to determine the pressure when given the velocity field from a stream function-vorticity solution. In Part II, the pressure equation is solved iteratively with the momentum (Navier-Stokes) equations on a non-staggered grid. In this case, the solution of the pressure equation not only provides the pressure, but also serves to indirectly satisfy the continuity equation. This primitive variables formulation has a major advantage over the stream function-vorticity method in its applicability for three-dimensional flow.

	Abstract = {The numerical simulation of real geomechanical problems often entails an high level of complexity; indeed they are often characterized by large deformations, soil-structure interaction and solid-fluid interaction. Moreover, the constitutive behavior of soil is highly non-linear. Landslides, dam failure, pile installation, and undrground excavation are typical examples of large deformation problems in which the interaction between solid a fluid phase as well as the contact between bodies are essential. This thesis addresses the challenging issue of the numerical simulation of large deformation problems in geomechanics. The standard lagrangian finite element methods are not well suited to treat extremely large deformations because of severe difficulties related with mesh distortions. The need to overcome their drawbacks urged researchers to devote considerable effort to the development of more advanced computational techniques such as meshless methods and mesh based particle methods. In this study, the Material Point Method (MPM), which is a mesh based particle method, is exploited to simulate large deformation problems in geomechanics. The MPM simulates large displacements with Lagrangian material points (MP) moving through a fixed mesh. The MP discretize the continuum body and carry all the information such as mass, velocity, acceleration, material properties, stress and strains, as well as external loads. The mesh discretizes the domain where the body move through; it is used to solve the equations of motion, but it does not store any permanent information. In undrained and drained conditions the presence of water can be simulated in a simplified way using the one-phase formulation. However, in many cases the relative movement of the water respect to the soil skeleton must be taken into account, thus requiring the use of the two-phase formulation. The contact between bodies is simulated with an algorithm specifically developed for the MPM at the beginning of the century. This algorithm was originally formulated for the frictional contact. It extension to the adhesive contact is considered in this thesis, which is well suited to simulate soil-structure interaction in case of cohesive materials. In this thesis typical geomechanical problems such as the collapse of a submerged slope and the simulation of cone penetration testing are considered. Numerical results are successfully compared with experimental data thus confirming the capability of the MPM to simulate complex phenomena.},

	Abstract = {A stabilized meshfree formulation for modeling nonlinear, multiphase porous media with application to landslide simulation is presented. To effectively capture the hydromechanical couplings between solid and fluid phases, an efficient equal-order approximation pair is adopted in conjunction with the fluid pressure projection in the mixed formulation, which avoids spurious pressure oscillations caused by the violation of the inf-sup condition. Although semi-Lagrangian meshfree methods are well-suited for modeling extremely large deformation phenomena, their performance is severely impacted by improper domain integration techniques. In this work, the naturally stabilized nodal integration (NSNI) technique is employed to achieve a stable and efficient reproducing kernel mixed formulation. By using the implicit gradient approximation, the gradients of strain and fluid flux fields are added into the mixed formulation to eliminate spurious low-energy modes of nodal integration. This procedure adds little computational effort to the overall analysis. In addition, a set of modified test functions is introduced to ensure the variational consistency in the Galerkin formulation for multiphase porous media. The convergence, stability, and effectiveness of the semi-Lagrangian meshfree formulation are examined and demonstrated in several numerical examples, including the post-failure modeling of a partially saturated levee.},

@article{Heinstein2000,
	Abstract = {In this article we discuss the treatment of contact - impact modeling in a large deformation explicit dynamic setting. Such problems are posed mathematically by demanding the usual satisfaction momentum balance equations and boundary conditions for each body separately, while imposing an additional set of constraints that govern the interaction of these bodies with each other. In applying such methods to contact problems we emphasize two requirements: first, that the treatment of contact should follow from the development of the local (weak) and global (strong) forms of the contact equations in the continuum setting. Algorithms developed from this framework are seen to readily handle the three-dimensional multi-body friction case. Second, and equally important especially in large applications is the practical aspect of computing the closest point projection for contact nodes, an essential component of defining the contact constraints. This calculation is global in nature, accounting for the fact that contact - impact involves multiple bodies interacting in unforeseeable ways. These requirements have guided the development of algorithms capable of treating contact - impact in PRONTO3D (M.W. Heinstein, S.W. Attaway, J.W. Swegle, F.J.

The proposed approach was first verified against an analytical solution for a plane strain compression test and then employed for the investigation of size dependent effects in localised failure of geomaterials.

@article{MiraPLL:03,
	Abstract = {In order to accurately model the behaviour of geostructures it is usually not possible to neglect the interaction between the soil skeleton and the pore fluid. Classical finite element models taking into account this interaction are formulated in terms of the displacement and pore pressure fields and are based on the assumption that the fluid acceleration relative to the soil skeleton is negligible. This type of mixed problems is similar to others found in solid and fluid mechanics and might give rise to numerical instabilities unless certain requirements are met. There are two classical approaches to this problem. The first is usually known as the Zienkiewicz-Taylor patch test for mixed formulations. As a consequence of this test the interpolation degree of the displacement field is required to be higher than the corresponding one of the pressure field. Mathematically speaking this is a necessary condition for stability. The second approach, mathematically more involved, is usually known as the Bab{\v u}ska-Brezzi inf-sup condition and constitutes a sufficient condition for stability. However it is possible to obtain stable formulations circumventing the interpolation degree requirement through the so-called stabilization techniques. These techniques were initially applied in the context of fluid mechanics and later extended to solid mechanics. This article presents a new formulation in which stabilization is achieved through an approach based on the Simo-Rifai enhanced strain element. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {The implementation of h-adaptivity for meshfree particle methods within a structured framework is described. In this framework, the initial particle arrangement is structured along with a background mesh, and outside boundaries and interior interfaces are described by implicit functions. The advantage of meshfree approximations in this framework lies in the ease of implementing h-adaptivity and the simplicity of the data structures. Particles can easily be added and removed without complications in the data structure, although there are some issues in the quadrature. An a posteriori error estimation is used for the adaptive refinement. An adaptive refinement strategy is applied to several linear elastic problems with high stress and strain gradients and singularities. Several non-linear examples are also given.},

These Newton-Krylov solvers are implemented in a matrix-free fashion for numerical efficiency. A description of the algorithms and evaluation of their performance is presented. On all test problems, if the time step is chosen appropriately, the implicit solution technique is more efficient than an explicit method without loss of desired features in the solutions.

@article{Netz2013,
	Abstract = {On the one hand, high-order quasi-static finite elements have been developed on the basis of isogeometric analysis or hierarchical shape functions based on integrated Legendre-polynomials, which display favorable behavior in comparison to linear element formulations. If we consider constitutive models of evolutionary-type such as elastoplasticity, viscoplasticity or viscoelasticity, only first order methods are employed to integrate the ordinary-differential equations at the Gauss-point level, leading to errors caused by the time-integration. On the other hand, high-order time integration methods have been devised to treat the resulting system of differential--algebraic equations (DAE-system) following the spatial discretization. This, however, is only done using spatial discretizations with linear or quadratic h-elements based on Lagrange polynomials or related mixed element formulations. In this article both approaches are combined using a p-version finite element approach on the basis of hierarchical shape functions and the resulting DAE-system is solved by means of high-order one-step methods. The first step in this treatise is to apply stiffly accurate, diagonally-implicit Runge--Kutta methods combined with the Multilevel-Newton algorithm. Since the computational outlay for computing the tangential stiffness matrix is very high in the case of p-version finite elements, Rosenbrock-type methods are applied as well, which lead to a completely iteration-free technique. We then compare the two approaches. The next step is to investigate three-dimensional examples showing the properties on the basis of a constitutive model in finite strain viscoelasticity.},

	Abstract = {Confined heterogeneous brittle solids loaded under far-field uniaxial compression are often observed to split along the loading axis. We develop a theory which accords this phenomenon an energetic interpretation : the solid splits because in so doing it reduces its total energy, defined as the sum of bulk strain energy and surface energy. The heterogeneous microstructure gives rise to a complex stress distribution in the intact solid. We show that the change in energy due to the release of the microstructural stresses may exceed the cost in fracture energy. Critical conditions for splitting are formulated for polycrystalline solids as a function of readily measurable material properties and applied stresses. The predictions of the theory are found to be in remarkably good agreement with experimental observations in ceramics and rocks. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved.},

The interpolations include quadratic elements and cubic splines in addition to the standard linear shape functions usually applied. For the small-strain problem of a vibrating bar, the best results are obtained using quadratic elements. It is shown that for more complex problems, the use of partially negative shape functions is inconsistent with the material-point method in its current form, necessitating other types of interpolation such as cubic splines in order to obtain smoother representations of field quantities. The properties of different interpolation functions are analysed using numerical examples, including the classical cantilevered beam problem.},

	Abstract = {A new constitutive law for the behaviour of undrained sand subjected to dynamic loading is presented. The proposed model works for small and large strain ranges and incorporates contractive and dilative properties of the sand into the unified numerical scheme. These features allow to correctly predict liquefaction and cyclic mobility phenomena for different initial relative densities of the soil. The model has been calibrated as an element test, by using cyclic simple shear data reported in the literature. For the contractive sand behaviour a well-known endochronic densification model has been used, whereas a plastic model with a new non-associative flow rule is applied when the sand tends to dilate. Both dilatancy and flow rule are based on a new state parameter, associated to the stiffness degradation of the material as the shaking goes on. Also, the function that represents the rearrangement memory of the soil takes a zero value when the material dilates, in order to easily model the change in the internal structure. Proceeding along this kind of approach, liquefaction and cyclic mobility are modelled with the same constitutive law, within the framework of a bi-dimensional FEM coupled algorithm developed in the paper. For calibration purposes, the behaviour of the soil in a cyclic simple shear test has been simulated, in order to estimate the influence of permeability, frequency of loading, and homogeneity of the shear stress field on the laboratory data.

	Abstract = {The deformation of poroelastic saturated media due to passing seismic waves results in coupled solid-fluid motion. Energy losses arise due to the viscous flow of the fluid with respect to the solid matrix. This implies that the flow condition at a saturated porous solid boundary might play a key role in seismic reflection and transmission. A detailed investigation is therefore carried out in this paper to verify this inference. The problem treated herein corresponds to the reflection and transmission of waves obliquely incident at an interface between fluid-saturated porous media and one-phase elastic fluid media. The interface is considered to be either permeable or impermeable to include the effect of flow condition. Based on the theoretical formulation derived, numerical investigations are carried out on the variations of the reflection and transmission coefficients with the angle of incidence as well as the frequency for different interface flow conditions. In addition, the behavior of permeability and porosity effects in the two interface cases is discussed. The results indicate that the effect of the interface flow condition is significant on the reflection and transmission characteristics, especially on the generation of the second kind of compressional waves. A comparison between our theoretical results and the reported experimental observation shows an essential agreement though the physical models considered are different. {\textcopyright} 1999 Academic Press.},

The machine consists of two main parts, the mechanical structure and the data acquisition system. The former is just a hammer, guided by two robust columns, which can impact the specimen with energy up to 7860 J. The latter consists of piezoelectric force sensors, accelerometers and optical fibre photoelectric sensors plus oscilloscopes and signal conditioners.

@article{Bui2017,
	Abstract = {In this paper, a computational framework based on the mesh-free smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method is developed to study the coupled behaviour of fluid and solid in a deformable porous medium. The mathematical framework developed herein is derived from the Biot's two-phase mixture theory in which the solid is modelled as an elasto-plastic material and the pore-fluid as an incompressible fluid. The key feature of the proposed numerical framework is that both solid and fluid phases are solved simultaneously in two different Lagrangian discretisations (or two different sets of Lagrangian particles) using their own governing equations that are linked through several laws of physics. The capability of the SPH method to model large deformation of the solid materials enables the framework to account for the permeability change due to the dilatant shear behaviour of the solid phase. To obtain a stable and accurate SPH solution for the pore-fluid, an incompressible SPH (ISPH) approach is adapted to correctly simulate the pore-pressure distribution of the fluid phase inside the porous medium. The proposed coupled SPH framework is firstly validated against analytical and solutions obtained using finite element method (FEM) for a submerged soil medium subjected to a gravitational load and a seepage flow through an elastic embankment, respectively. Then, it is employed for the simulation of flows through rockfill dams and an embankment failure induced by seepage flows. Simulation results predicted by SPH show very good agreements with analytical, FEM and experimental results. This suggests that the proposed two-phase SPH framework is a promising approach for future studies of coupled problems that involve complex water free-surface/seepage flows and large deformation of soils which are difficult to be modelled using traditional FEM-based coupled two-phase flow models.},

	Abstract = {A Lagrangian finite element model of ductile penetration is developed. Adaptive meshing is accorded a key role in following the large deformations which develop during penetration. An explicit contact/friction algorithm is used to treat the multi-body dynamics. Rate-dependent plasticity, heat conduction and thermal coupling are also accounted for in the calculations. The properties and predictive ability of the model are exhibited in several applications: copper rod impact, perforation of aluminum plates by conical-nosed projectiles and penetration of high-strength steel targets by WHA long rods. The simulations show close agreement with experimental observations and prior numerical results.},

	Abstract = {We present a Lagrangian phase-field method to study the low Reynolds number dynamics of vesicles embedded in a viscous fluid. In contrast to previous approaches, where the field variables are the phase-field and the fluid velocity, here we exploit the fact that the phase-field tracks a material interface to reformulate the problem in terms of the Lagrangian motion of a background medium, containing both the biomembrane and the fluid. We discretize the equations in space with maximum-entropy approximants, carefully shown to perform well in phase-field models of biomembranes in a companion paper. The proposed formulation is variational, lending itself to implicit time-stepping algorithms based on minimization of a time-incremental energy, which are automatically nonlinearly stable. The proposed method deals with two of the major challenges in the numerical treatment of coupled fluid/phase-field models of biomembranes, namely the adaptivity of the grid to resolve the sharp features of the phase-field, and the stiffness of the equations, leading to very small time-steps. In our method, local refinement follows the features of the phase-field as both are advected by the Lagrangian motion, and large time-steps can be robustly chosen in the variational time-stepping algorithm, which also lends itself to time adaptivity. The method is presented in the axisymmetric setting, but it can be directly extended to 3D. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {Numerical modelling of chip formation is important for a better understanding thus for an improvement of the high speed metal cutting process. The challenge in the modelling of chip formation lies in capturing the shear band formation, the material separation and the tool-chip interaction accurately. Mostly, some assumptions are made when modelling the material separation and the serrated morphology generation, which leads to an unrealistic prediction of the chip formation. In this work, both the serrated morphology on the chip upper surface and the material separation at the chip root are treated using a ductile fracture model. Additionally, a recently developed Galerkin type meshfree scheme, the stabilizedoptimal transportation meshfree (OTM) method is applied as a numerical solution method in combination with a material point erosion approach. This enables the modelling of material separation and serrated morphology generation of the cutting process in a more realistical and convenient way. The frictional contact force exerted by the cutting tool is imposed on the workpiece using a predictor-corrector strategy. The shear band formation is described by the thermal softening term in the Johnson--Cook plastic flow stress model. Using this model, it can be demonstrated that thermal softening is the main cause for the shear band formation. However, this phenomenon is under-predicted by the Johnson--Cook flow stress model. Additionally, it can be seen that the Johnson--Cook fracture model shows limitations in capturing the fracture on the chip upper surface. Thus, a supplementary condition for the stress triaxiality is applied. This condition allows a more accurate measurement of the chip size, like chip spacing, peak and valley. These improvements are demonstrated by comparing the calculated chip morphology, cutting force and chip formation process with experimental results.},

@article{Beuth2010,
	Abstract = {The Finite Element Method (FEM) has become the standard tool for the analysis of a wide range of solid mechanics problems. However, the underlying structure of a classical updated Lagrangian FEM is not well suited for the treatment of large deformation problems, since excessive mesh distortions can lead to numerical difficulties. The Material Point Method (MPM) represents an approach in which material points moving through a fixed finite element grid are used to simulate large deformations. As the method makes use of moving material points, it can also be classified as a point-based or meshless method. With no mesh distor- tions, it is an ideal tool for the analysis of large deformation problems. MPM has its origin in fluid mechanics and has only recently been applied to solid mechanics problems. It has been used successfully for impact analyses where bodies penetrate each other and for silo discharging problems. All existing MPM codes found in literature are dynamic codes with explicit time integration and only recently implicit time integration. In this study a quasi-static MPM formulation and implementation are presented. The paper starts with the de- scription of the quasi-static governing equations and the numerical discretisation. Afterwards, the calculation process of the quasi-static MPM is explained, followed by the presentation of benchmark problems which have been calculated with the newly developed quasi-static MPM code. The benchmark problems consist of the oedometer test and large elastic bending of a cantilever beam. For validation, the results are compared with analytical solutions and FEM results.},

	Abstract = {Different classes of constitutive models have been proposed to capture the time-dependent behaviour of soft soil (creep, stress relaxation, rate dependency). This paper critically reviews many of the models developed based on understanding of the time dependent stress-strain-stress rate-strain rate behaviour of soils and viscoplasticity in terms of their strengths and weaknesses. Some discussion is also made on the numerical implementation aspects of these models. Typical findings from numerical analyses of geotechnical structures constructed on soft soils are also discussed. The general elastic viscoplastic (EVP) models can roughly be divided into two categories: models based on the concept of overstress and models based on non-stationary flow surface theory. Although general in structure, both categories have their own strengths and shortcomings. This review indicates that EVP analysis is yet to be vastly used by the geotechnical engineers, apparently due to the mathematical complication involved in the formulation of the constitutive models, unconvincing benefit in terms of the accuracy of performance prediction, requirement of additional soil parameter(s), difficulties in determining them, and the necessity of excessive computing resources and time. {\textcopyright} 2013 Taylor {\&} Francis.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents the investigation of consolidation for radial drainage under linear time-dependent loading with varying loading-dependent coefficients of radial consolidation by using a viscoelastic approach. By extending Barron's solution for radial consolidation of small strain sustained constant load, the convolution integral with time as the variable was used to analyze the consolidation under time-dependent loading. Four different loading rates were applied in the consolidation tests on three types of remolded clay with various plasticity indices to study the behavior of radial consolidation. The variation of the coefficient of radial consolidation versus effective stress was determined by explicitly performing falling head radial permeability tests at various loading stages in a modified consolidometer through a series of radial consolidation tests. The aforementioned relationship was converted to the coefficient of radial consolidation with the loading time of the corresponding pressure applied to the specimen for each specific loading rate test. The convolution integral of the viscoelastic theory was then applied for the prediction of consolidation settlement versus time for each loading rate test. The findings indicated that the viscoelastic settlement prediction, in terms of the average degree of radial consolidation using the loading-dependent coefficients of radial consolidation, is more consistent with the experimental results compared with those when assuming a constant coefficient of radial consolidation.

	Abstract = {A physically based impact model---already known and exploited in the field of sound synthesis---is studied using both analytical tools and numerical simulations. It is shown that the Hamiltonian of a physical system composed of a mass impacting on a wall can be expressed analytically as a function of the mass velocity during contact. Moreover, an efficient and accurate ap- proximation for the mass outbound velocity is presented, which allows to estimate the Hamiltonian at the end of the contact. Analytical results are then compared to numerical simulations ob- tained by discretizing the system with several numerical methods. It is shown that, for some regions of the parameter space, the tra- jectories of the discretized systems may significantly drift from the analytically derived curves. Two approaches, based on enforcing numerical energy consistency, are then proposed to improve the accuracy of numerical simulations.},

	Abstract = {With the use of the u--p form governing equations of saturated porous media, the coupling material point method (CMPM) is developed to predict the dynamic responses of saturated soil. The contact/impact problem between saturated porous media and solid bodies, like soil--structure interaction, is solved under the framework of the MPM. In the proposed strategy, the dynamic analysis of saturated soil and solid bodies is handled by the CMPM and the original MPM respectively. The interaction between saturated soil and solid bodies is simulated by a new contact algorithm which effectively avoids the interpenetration between saturated soil and solid bodies. The proposed approach circumvents the difficulties associated with the conventional spatial discretization methods such as the finite element method in simulating the contact/impact behavior between saturated soil and solid bodies. Representative examples are used to verify the proposed model-based simulation procedure and to demonstrate its potential in impact analysis related to geotechnical engineering.},

	Abstract = {The study of the collapse of a granular step is of great interest for understanding transient dense granular flow conditions and for modeling geophysical flows in granular materials. We present the results of a series of finite elements simulations considering variable column aspect ratios and properties for an elastoplastic material with a Mohr-Coulomb yield rule and nonassociate flow rule. The adopted approach does not suffer limitations of typical shallow water equation methods, being able to consider strong vertical motion components. Transition from initial instability to complete flow development is simulated for columns with different aspect ratios (a {\textless}= 20). Simulation results are compared to original tests and available well-documented experimental data, in terms of flow development, duration, profile geometry, velocity distribution, erosion and deposition, and evolution of the interface between static and moving material. Tests involving a thick erodible layer have been performed and numerical simulation results are compared also with a real case study. Numerical results support both those of qualitative and theoretical models and the proposed general scaling laws and clarify the dependence on frictional properties. Power laws describe the normalized runout versus aspect ratio (a {\textgreater} 4) relationship with constants of proportionality dependent on internal friction angle and exponents ranging between 0.68 and 0.77, in good agreement with experimental results. Total duration and evolution in three successive phases agree with observations. Time for the flow front to cease motion with respect to aspect ratio is best represented by the 3.68a(0.448) relationships for a 30 degrees internal friction angle material.},

	Abstract = {The problem of the finite axisymmetric deformation of a thick-walled circular cylindrical elastic tube subject to pressure on its external lateral boundaries and zero displacement on its ends is formulated for an incompressible isotropic neo-Hookean material. The formulation is fully nonlinear and can accommodate large strains and large displacements. The governing system of nonlinear partial differential equations is derived and then solved numerically using the C++ based object-oriented finite element library Libmesh. The weighted residual-Galerkin method and the Newton-Krylov nonlinear solver are adopted for solving the governing equations. Since the nonlinear problem is highly sensitive to small changes in the numerical scheme, convergence was obtained only when the analytical Jacobian matrix was used. A Lagrangian mesh is used to discretize the governing partial differential equations. Results are presented for different parameters, such as wall thickness and aspect ratio, and comparison is made with the corresponding linear elasticity formulation of the problem, the results of which agree with those of the nonlinear formulation only for small external pressure. Not surprisingly, the nonlinear results depart significantly from the linear ones for larger values of the pressure and when the strains in the tube wall become large. Typical nonlinear characteristics exhibited are the "corner bulging" of short tubes, and multiple modes of deformation for longer tubes. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Masson SAS.

	Abstract = {Solutions of direct time-integration schemes that converge in time to conventional semidiscrete formulations may be polluted at small time steps by spurious spatial oscillations, along with attendant overshoot in time. This degradation is not an artifact of the time-marching scheme, but rather a property of the solution of the semidiscrete formulation itself. A critical time step for the onset of spatial oscillations is derived by analogy to singularly perturbed elliptic problems. We then propose a simple procedure of spatial stabilization to remove this pathology from implicit time-integration schemes, without affecting unconditional temporal stability. Spatially stabilized implicit time integration is free of spurious spatial oscillations at small time steps, and numerical experience points to improved temporal accuracy as well. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {Based on the u-p form governing equations and the convected particle domain interpolation technique, the improved convected particle domain interpolation based material point method (CCPDI) is developed in this paper for the coupled dynamic and contact analysis of fully saturated porous media involving large deformation. The numerical artifact noises due to material points crossing computational grid boundaries that usually occur in large deformation are eliminated by using the smoother interpolation functions presented in the convected particle domain interpolation technique. The discrete equations are derived in the framework of the generalized interpolation material point method. The boundary load tracking algorithm and a modified contact algorithm are proposed based on the definition of particle domains to apply accurately the surface loads on the motive boundaries and to capture correctly the contact time/behaviors in large deformation problems, respectively. Simulations of several representative one- and two-dimensional problems are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods. Compared to those obtained by using the coupling material point method and/or finite element method, the simulation results illustrate that the proposed CCPDI method can be successfully used in simulating the large deformation coupled dynamic responses of the solid skeleton and fluid phase in fully saturated porous media and the large deformation impact between solid and saturated porous bodies.},

	Abstract = {The material point method (MPM) for solid mechanics conserves mass and momentum by construction, but energy conservation is not explicitly enforced. Material constitutive response and internal energy are carried on discrete points (material points), while the governing equations are solved on an overlying grid. The constitutive response (and internal energy) may be updated at the beginning or end of a numerical time step without affecting mass or momentum conservation properties. Both versions of the algorithm have been applied in the literature. Here energy conservation on the material points is investigated and found to depend strongly on the version of the algorithm used. The energy error is found and partitioned into two terms, one of which is of definite sign (and dissipative). The other term is indefinite, and of opposite sign for the two algorithmic variations. It is shown analytically for a single-material-point free-vibration example that one version of the algorithm is strictly dissipative. For the other version the error terms cancel each other out and energy is conserved. The same trends are borne out in numerical solutions of free axial vibration of continuum bars as the wavelength of the vibrational mode begins to approach the computational cell size. The dissipative algorithm may be described as tending to damp out unresolved modes. For resolved modes, both algorithms give identical results, with no perceptible energy error or dissipation. It is suggested that the dissipative algorithm is a better choice in general, as the damping is consistent with the accuracy of the solution.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a formulation of dynamic contact problems which enables exact algorithmic conservation of linear momentum, angular momentum, and energy in finite element simulations. It is seen that a Lagrange multiplier enforcement of an appropriate contact rate constraint produces these conservation properties. A related method is presented in which a penalty regularization of the aforementioned rate constraint is utilized. This penalty method sacrifices the energy conservation property, but is dissipative under all conditions of changing contact so that the global algorithm remains stable. Notably, it is also shown that augmented Lagrangian iteration utilizing this penalty kernel reproduces the energy conserving (i.e. Lagrange multiplier) solution to any desired degree of accuracy. The result is a robust, stable method even in the context of large deformations, as is shown by some representative numerical examples. In particular, the ability of the formulation to produce accurate results where more traditional integration schemes fail is emphasized by the numerical simulations.},

	Abstract = {Frictional contact is commonly represented in the Material Point Method (MPM) by algorithms based on multi-velocity fields, in which the correction is performed at the background computational mesh. Typically for applications of various stiffness values, these algorithms show a non-physical variation in the contact stresses along the interface surface. The lack of a smoothening function in the detection procedure, which is essential in explicit finite element algorithms, contributes to the stress oscillation and causes a gap between the bodies in contact. For MPM versions with a finite particle size, like Convected Particle Domain Interpolation method (CPDI), the effect of the last shortcoming becomes more pronounced. Results can be improved by using denser mesh, however, the computational cost will increase considerably. In the present paper, the boundary of a continuum object is discretised separately from the MPM discretisation and traced accurately during the solution advancement. Therefore, contact forces among different boundaries are evaluated using a penalty function method commonly implemented in Lagrangian analyses. These forces are then mapped to the computational mesh, where the momentum equation is solved, as an external force. The suggested approach is validated with a benchmark problem, where the closed-form solution is available, and compared to the classical MPM contact algorithm. Furthermore, an application of two bodies collision with large deformation is demonstrated.},

	Abstract = {En esta tesis se trata de la adaptaci{\'{o}}n del M{\'{e}}todo del Punto Material al an{\'{a}}lisis de problemas geot{\'{e}}cnicos incluyendo el comportamiento hidromec{\'{a}}nico de materiales en condici{\'{o}}n saturada. El M{\'{e}}todo del Punto Material {\'{o}} MPM (Sulsky et al. 1994, Sulsky et al. 1996) combina ventajas del m{\'{e}}todo de los elementos finitos y de los m{\'{e}}todos de part{\'{i}}culas. Podr{\'{i}}a describirse como una extensi{\'{o}}n del m{\'{e}}todo de los elementos finitos en el que se utiliza una malla para resolver las ecuaciones de gobierno, mientras que el continuo {\'{o}} el material se representan mediante "puntos materiales" {\'{o}} "part{\'{i}}culas" langrangianas de masa fija. En el MPM la informaci{\'{o}}n que transportan las part{\'{i}}culas: cantidad de movimiento, tensi{\'{o}}n, deformaci{\'{o}}n etc. se "proyecta" en la malla para cada paso de la soluci{\'{o}}n. Esta cubre {\'{i}}ntegramente el dominio del problema y en ella se imponen las condiciones de contorno. Luego de resolver en la malla las formas discretas de las ecuaciones de gobierno, se actualiza la posici{\'{o}}n de las part{\'{i}}culas y la informaci{\'{o}}n que transportan. As{\'{i}}, al final de cada paso, la malla puede descartarse porque toda la informaci{\'{o}}n la transportan las part{\'{i}}culas. Se evitan al mismo tiempo la distorsi{\'{o}}n de la malla para grandes desplazamientos (mesh tangling) y los problemas de convecci{\'{o}}n. El m{\'{e}}todo se adapta especialmente a problemas din{\'{a}}micos de grandes desplazamientos y deformaciones finitas e incorpora en forma natural un algoritmo de contacto sin deslizamiento que facilita su utilizaci{\'{o}}n en problemas de interacci{\'{o}}n entre s{\'{o}}lidos. El an{\'{a}}lisis de problemas geot{\'{e}}cnicos hidromec{\'{a}}nicos utilizando el MPM requiere del desarrollo de algoritmos para resolver el acoplamiento entre el esqueleto de suelo y las fases agua y/o aire y de la regularizaci{\'{o}}n del problema de localizaci{\'{o}}n de deformaciones para evitar que las soluciones dependan en forma patol{\'{o}}gica de la malla, que en el caso del MPM es una malla "soporte". En este trabajo se ha desarrollado un algoritmo expl{\'{i}}cito, en el marco del M{\'{e}}todo del Punto Material, que resuelve el problema acoplado presi{\'{o}}n de poros-desplazamiento. Adem{\'{a}}s se ha adaptado al MPM un procedimiento num{\'{e}}rico para la introducci{\'{o}}n de discontinuidades fuertes en la malla soporte (Wells et al. 2001, Wells et al. 2002). Se ha continuado con el desarrollo del c{\'{o}}digo Geopart (Zabala et al, 2004) que utiliza una versi{\'{o}}n expl{\'{i}}cita del MPM con un algoritmo incrementalmente objetivo para deformaciones finitas que incluye: construcci{\'{o}}n, an{\'{a}}lisis acoplado presi{\'{o}}n-desplazamiento en tensiones efectivas y modelos constitutivos sencillos. En general el colapso de presas de materiales sueltos es inadmisible. Las presas utilizadas para almacenar agua se ubican en muchos casos, aguas arriba de ciudades importantes, en zonas donde la amenaza s{\'{i}}smica puede ser muy alta. Por otro lado el porcentaje mayor de los colapsos ocurridos en el mundo corresponde a los de presas de residuos mineros. En particular el colapso de la presa de residuos mineros de Aznalc{\'{o}}llar, (Alonso et al. 2006, Alonso et al. 2006, Gens et al. 2006) que se toma en esta tesis como caso de estudio, caus{\'{o}} un da{\~{n}}o ambiental muy importante. Este es un caso muy interesante por sus caracter{\'{i}}sticas de rotura progresiva, que ha sido generada por la construcci{\'{o}}n extendida durante muchos a{\~{n}}os del dique y la existencia de una arcilla fr{\'{a}}gil de muy baja permeabilidad en su fundaci{\'{o}}n. La simulaci{\'{o}}n y explicaci{\'{o}}n del mecanismo de colapso observado en Aznalcollar no es trivial. Se ha modelado la construcci{\'{o}}n de la presa y el proceso de su falla progresiva hasta el colapso. Adem{\'{a}}s se ha estudiado el comportamiento din{\'{a}}mico con grandes deformaciones de una presa de grava con pantalla de hormig{\'{o}}n ubicada una zona donde la amenaza s{\'{i}}smica es muy elevada.},

	Abstract = {The present article concerns a general approach to porous media elasto-plasticity by use of the theory of mixtures extended by the volume fraction concept. The investigations are based on a macroscopic binary model of incompressible constituents, solid skeleton and liquid, where, in the constitutive range, use is made of the second-grade character of general heterogeneous media. Thus, finite elasto-plasticity results in a multiplicative decomposition of both the first and the second solid deformation gradients. Apart from the general set of thermodynamical restrictions, the inclusion of the plastic deformation gradients among the list of constitutive variables reveals a restriction for a finite representation for the back-stress tensor of kinematically hardening second-grade solid materials. A simplified constitutive model is included and, in addition, finite constitutive equations are given suitable to describe the elastic as well as the plastic response of the medium under discussion. The constitutive model applies to ductile as well as to brittle and granular liquid-saturated or empty solid materials. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

	Abstract = {A meshless approach to the analysis of arbitrary Kirchhoff shells by the Element-Free Galerkin (EFG) method is presented. The shell theory used is geometrically exact and can be applied to deep shells. The method is based on moving least squares approximant. The method is meshless, which means that the discretization is independent of the geometric subdivision into "finite elements". The satisfaction of the C1 continuity requirements is easily met by EFG since it requires only C1 weights; therefore, it is not necessary to resort to Mindlin-Reissner theory or to devices such as discrete Kirchhoff theory. The requirements of consistency are met by the use of a polynomial basis of quadratic or higher order. A subdivision similar to finite elements is used to provide a background mesh for numerical integration. The essential boundary conditions are enforced by Lagrange multipliers. Membrane locking, which is due to different approximation order for transverse and membrane displacements, is removed by using larger domains of influence with the quadratic basis, and by using quartic polynomial basis, which can prevent membrane locking completely. It is shown on the obstacle course for shells that the present technique performs well. Published by Elsevier Science Ltd.},

	Abstract = {The Finite Element Method (FEM) is widely used in the simulation of geotechnical applications. Owing to the limitations of FEM to model problems involving large deformations, many efforts have been made to develop methods free of mesh entanglement. One of these methods is the Material Point Method (MPM) which models the material as Lagrangian particles capable of moving through a background computational mesh in Eulerian manner. Although MPM represents the continuum by material points, solution is performed on the computational mesh. Thus, imposing boundary conditions is not aligned with the material representation. In this paper, a non-zero kinematic condition is introduced where an additional set of particles is incorporated to track the moving boundary. This approach is then applied to simulate the seismic motion resulting in failure of slopes. To validate this simulation procedure, two geotechnical applications are modelled using MPM. The first is to reproduce a shaking table experiment where the results of another numerical method are available. After validating the present numerical scheme for relatively large deformation problem, it is applied to simulate progression of a large-scale landslide during the Chi-Chi earthquake of Taiwan in which excessive material deformation and transportation is taking place.},

@article{Lourenco2006,
	Abstract = {Field observations and theoretical analysis have been used in the literature to assess slope instability caused by permeability variations. This investigation aims to study the influence of permeability variations on slope behaviour by experimental means. It focuses particularly on the pore water pressure generation in the vicinity of soils with different permeabilities, and the corresponding failure mode. A series of generated failures in a model with 2 soil layers was performed by means of a flume device. The soil layers were made of a medium-sized sand and a fine sand, placed in horizontal layers. A combination of photography and pore water pressure measurements was used to examine the relationship between the pore water pressure generation and failure modes. Experiments were conducted for different arrangements of soil layers (by changing the soil layer position), and infiltration direction (downward infiltration by sprinkling water on the soil, and upward infiltration from the bottom of the lower soil layer). The results revealed no clear link between the failure mode and recorded pore water pressure. Instead, the failure mode was seen to depend mostly on the relative layer position, and the recorded pore water pressures on the imposed infiltration direction. Failure was not confined to a single failure mode, but ranged instead from retrogressive slides and lateral spreads to seepage erosion. Regarding the hydrologic response, interesting results were recorded for experiments performed by downward infiltration, where perched water tables were formed. The granular nature of both soils and the absence of an impermeable barrier at the downslope end of the model seem to have favoured water seepage as the controlling failure mechanism, enhancing seepage erosion and sliding, and restricting other failure modes that require a high soil saturation such as flow failure. As the drainage conditions were not controlled, these experiments provided a unique opportunity to study the effect of water seepage as a trigger. In some experiments, failure evolution was seen to be dominated by sand washout, which started after the pore water pressure reached its maximum, suggesting that the dragging effect of seepage forces have a minor impact on triggering failure. An extra set of experiments conducted in a triaxial apparatus supported the efficacy of pore water pressure as a trigger rather than the dragging effect of seepage forces. The results obtained here provide an insight into the pre-failure mechanisms and processes of heterogeneous natural slopes. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The objective of the article is to present a unified model for the$\backslash$ndynamic mechanical response of ceramics under compressive stress$\backslash$nstates. The model incorporates three principal deformation mechanisms:$\backslash$n(i) lattice plasticity due to dislocation glide or twinning; (ii)$\backslash$nmicrocrack extension; and (iii) granular flow of densely packed comminuted$\backslash$nparticles. In addition to analytical descriptions of each mechanism,$\backslash$nprescriptions are provided for their implementation into a finite$\backslash$nelement code as well as schemes for mechanism transitions. The utility$\backslash$nof the code in addressing issues pertaining to deep penetration is$\backslash$ndemonstrated through a series of calculations of dynamic cavity expansion$\backslash$nin an infinite medium. The results reveal two limiting behavioral$\backslash$nregimes, dictated largely by the ratio of the cavity pressure p to$\backslash$nthe material yield strength rY. At low values of p/rY, cavity expansion$\backslash$noccurs by lattice plasticity and hence its rate diminishes with increasing$\backslash$nrY. In contrast, at high values, expansion occurs by microcracking$\backslash$nfollowed by granular plasticity and is therefore independent of rY.$\backslash$nIn the intermediate regime, the cavity expansion rate is governed$\backslash$nby the interplay between microcracking and lattice plasticity. That$\backslash$nis, when lattice plasticity is activated ahead of the expanding cavity,$\backslash$nthe stress triaxiality decreases (toward more negative values) which,$\backslash$nin turn, reduces the propensity for microcracking and the rate of$\backslash$ngranular flow. The implications for penetration resistance to high-velocity$\backslash$nprojectiles are discussed. Finally, the constitutive model is used$\backslash$nto simulate the quasi-static and dynamic indentation response of$\backslash$na typical engineering ceramic (alumina) and the results compared$\backslash$nto experimental measurements. Some of the pertinent observations$\backslash$nare shown to be captured by the present model whereas others require$\backslash$nalternative approaches (such as those based on fracture mechanics)$\backslash$nfor complete characterization.},

	Abstract = {A new approach for modelling discrete cracks in meshfree particle methods in three dimensions is described. The cracks can be arbitrarily oriented, but their growth is represented discretely by activation of crack surfaces at individual particles, so no representation of the crack's topology is needed. The crack is modelled by a local enrichment of the test and trial functions with a sign function (a variant of the Heaviside step function), so that the discontinuities are along the direction of the crack. The discontinuity consists of cylindrical planes centered at the particles. The method is formulated for large deformations and arbitrary nonlinear and rate-dependent materials; cohesive laws govern the traction-crack opening relations. To reduce computational cost and since more accuracy around the crack tip is needed to obtain adequate results, h-adaptivity is incorporated in the method. The model is applied to several three-dimensional problems, some of which are compared to experimental data. ?? 2007.},

@article{Nguyen2017,
	Abstract = {The smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method was recently extended to simulate granular materials by the authors and demonstrated to be a powerful continuum numerical method to deal with the post-flow behaviour of granular materials. However, most existing SPH simulations of granular flows suffer from significant stress oscillation during the post-failure process, despite the use of an artificial viscosity to damp out stress fluctuation. In this paper, a new SPH approach combining viscous damping with stress/strain regularisation is proposed for simulations of granular flows. It is shown that the proposed SPH algorithm can improve the overall accuracy of the SPH performance by accurately predicting the smooth stress distribution during the post-failure process. It can also effectively remove the stress oscillation issue in the standard SPH model without having to use the standard SPH artificial viscosity that requires unphysical parameters. The predictions by the proposed SPH approach show very good agreement with experimental and numerical results reported in the literature. This suggests that the proposed method could be considered as a promising continuum alternative for simulations of granular flows. {\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

Solid grains and water are assumed to be incompressible at the microscopic level. The isotropic elastoplastic behaviour of the solid skeleton is described by the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into an elastic and a plastic part. The effective stress state is limited by the Drucker-Prager yield surface, for which a particular "apex formulation" is advocated. The water is assumed to obey Darcy's law.

If the compression modulus of a constituent is much larger than the compression modulus of the bulk material this constituent is assumed to be materially incompressible. A common example is soil. Governing equations for such materials are found in the framework of Biot's theory either for the unknowns solid displacement and pore pressure or for the unknowns solid displacement and fluid displacement. For both formulations fundamental solutions are derived using the method of H{\"{o}}rmander. Unlike the uis-p formulation, where the incompressible model can be obtained applying a limiting procedure directly to the compressible system of equations, a complete new derivation is necessary for the uis-uifformulation. This yields a model of incompressibility different from that of the uis-p formulation which seems to be not suitable for poroelastodynamic problems. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Rainfall-induced slope failures are a major category of slope failure, with incidents likely to increase with the predicted escalation of extreme rainfall events. Traditional numerical methods such as the finite element method are often restricted in their applicability to small deformation analyses. Therefore, incomplete descriptions of the failure mechanism and failure consequence may be obtained, due to the evolving deformations and progressive failure being ignored. A one-point, two-phase material point method (MPM) formulation is proposed to consider the influence of rainfall on slope failure. Due to the characteristics of MPM in capturing the large deformations, the complete failure process, from initiation to failure, of a slope subjected to rainfall infiltration is presented. The soil behaviour is described by a Mohr--Coulomb strain-softening model based on Bishop's effective stress. The two-phase analysis shows that the rainfall-affected slope is initially stable, until the soil shear strength reduces due to the reduction of suction in the slope starting from the surface, leading to a superficial failure mode, which in turn leads to a complete slope failure. Friction angle and residual cohesion are shown to play important roles in the development of the slope failure.},

	Abstract = {Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) methods are synergistic combinations of Newton-type methods for superlinearly convergent solution of nonlinear equations and Krylov subspace methods for solving the Newton correction equations. The link between the two methods is the Jacobian-vector product, which may be probed approximately without forming and storing the elements of the true Jacobian, through a variety of means, Various approximations to the Jacobian matrix may still be required for preconditioning the resulting Krylov iteration. As with Krylov methods for linear problems, successful application of the JFNK method to any given problem is dependent on adequate preconditioning. JFNK has potential for application throughout problems governed by nonlinear partial differential equations and integro-differential equations. In this survey paper, we place JFNK in context with other nonlinear solution algorithms for both boundary value problems (BVPs) and initial value problems (IVPs). We provide an overview of the mechanics of JFNK and attempt to illustrate the wide variety of preconditioning options available. It is emphasized that JFNK can be wrapped (as an accelerator) around another nonlinear fixed point method (interpreted as a preconditioning process, potentially with significant code reuse). The aim of this paper is not to trace fully the evolution of JFNK, nor to provide proofs of accuracy or optimal convergence for all of the constituent methods, but rather to present the reader with a perspective on how JFNK may be applicable to applications of interest and to provide sources of further practical information. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {Natural neighbour co-ordinates (Sibson co-ordinates) is a well-known interpolation scheme for multivariate data fitting and smoothing. The numerical implementation of natural neighbour co-ordinates in a Galerkin method is known as the natural element method (NEM). In the natural element method, natural neighbour co-ordinates are used to construct the trial and test functions. Recent studies on NEM have shown that natural neighbour co-ordinates, which are based on the Voronoi tessellation of a set of nodes, are an appealing choice to construct meshless interpolants for the solution of partial differential equations. In Belikov et al. (Computational Mathematics and Mathematical Physics 1997; 37(1) : 9-15), a new interpolation scheme (non-Sibsonian interpolation) based on natural neighbours was proposed. In the present paper, the non-Sibsonian interpolation scheme is reviewed and its performance in a Galerkin method for the solution of elliptic partial differential equations that arise in linear elasticity is studied. A methodology to couple finite elements to NEM is also described. Two significant advantages of the non-Sibson interpolant over the Sibson interpolant are revealed and numerically verified: the computational efficiency of the non-Sibson algorithm in 2-dimensions, which is expected to carry over to 3-dimensions, and the ability to exactly impose essential boundary conditions on the boundaries of convex and non-convex domains.

In particular, we present extensions of the PFEM for the analysis of the interaction between a collection of bodies in water allowing for frictional contact conditions at the fluid--solid and solid--solid interfaces via mesh generation. An algorithm to treat bed erosion in free surface flows is also presented. Examples of application of the PFEM to solve a number of fluid--multibody interaction problems involving splashing of waves, large motions of floating and submerged bodies and bed erosion situations are given.},

	Abstract = {This paper focuses on the treatment of volume constraints which in the context of elasto-plasticity typically arise as a result of assuming volume-preserving plastic flow. Projection methods based on the modification of the discrete gradient operator B, often proposed on an ad-hoc basis, are systematically obtained in the variational context furnished by a three-field Hu-Washizu principle. The fully nonlinear formulation proposed here is based on a local multiplicative split of the deformation gradient into volume-preserving and dilatational parts, without relying on rate forms of the weak form of momentum balance. This approach fits naturally in a formulation of plasticity based on the multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient, and enables one to exactly enforce the condition of volume-preserving plastic flow. Within the framework proposed in this paper, rate forms and incrementally objective algorithms are entirely bypassed. {\textcopyright} 1985.},

A finite element discretization in the space dimension is used and a semi-discretization process followed (as introducled in Chapters 3 and 5). For structural problems the result is a set of equations involving a mass, damping and stiffness matrix. The second order equation in time may be solved formally using analytical methods in which time is represented by exponential functions. For undamped systems this leads to a classical eigen-problem in which the natural frequencies and mode shapes for a system may be identified. Including damping makes the solution feasible in complex arithmetic. General transient solutions are obtained from modal representations. A second form is forced periodic response in which applied force is represented in periodic form.},

It is further argued that it is usually an inappropriate response to develop methods which a priori suppress these wiggles and thereby make claims that these unconventional FEM techniques are actually improvements and can be used to solve difficult problems on coarse meshes. {\textcopyright} 1981.},

	Abstract = {The modeling of mechanical properties of materials and structures is a complex and wide-ranging subject. In some applications, it is sufficient to assume that the material remains elastic, i.e. that the deformation process is fully reversible and the stress is a unique function of strain. However, such a simplified assumption is appropriate only within a limited range, and in general must be replaced by a more realistic approach that takes into account the inelastic processes such as plastic yielding or cracking. This book presents a comprehensive treatment of the most important areas of plasticity and of time-dependent inelastic behavior (viscoplasticity of metals, and creep and shrinkage of concrete). It covers structural aspects such as: * incremental analysis * limit analysis * shakedown analysis * optimal design * beam structures subjected to bending and torsion * yield line theory of plates * slip line theory * size effect in structures * creep and shrinkage effects in concrete structures. The following aspects of the advanced material modeling are presented: * yield surfaces for metals and plastic-frictional materials * hardening and softening * stress-return algorithms * large-strain formulations * thermodynamic framework * microplane models * localization of plastic strain. Inelastic Analysis of Structures is a textbook for basic and advanced courses on plasticity, with a slight emphasis on structural engineering applications, but with a wealth of material for geotechnical, mechanical, aerospace, naval, petroleum and nuclear engineers. The text is constructed in a very didactical way, while the mathematics has been kept rigorous.},

Ellipsis uses a hybrid particle in a cell scheme, which combines a fixed mesh of computational points and a dense arrangement of mobile material points. The fixed Eulerian mesh allows very fast computation, performed in Ellipsis via a multigrid iteration method, while the Lagrangian particle reference frame allows the tracking of material interfaces and history-dependent properties such as strain history for strain-softening materials. The method is exceptionally useful in very large deformation analyses, where purely Lagrangian approaches would be severely hampered by the need for remeshing to minimize element distortion. The Gnu Public Licensed Ellipsis3D code lends itself to combined 2D/3D model prototyping, and has proven to be an excellent geodynamics teaching tool for modelling, covering mantle convection, lithospheric extension and plume-lithosphere interaction. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {The paper presents the results of the application of the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) to the analysis of landslides in reservoirs. This is a complex phenomenon, because of the interaction between the landslide, the still water in the reservoir and the dam. PFEM combines a Lagrangian approach with the solution of the governing equations of the problem using the FEM. A mesh connecting the initial set of particles (nodes) is re-generated in every time step. Some validation cases are presented, in which PFEM results are compared with experimental data. More complex calculations have been made over the actual geometry of reservoirs taken from the cartographic information of the sites. In these cases the wave generation, its propagation and dam overtopping are reproduced. Finally, Lituya bay rock slide in which 90 × 106 tons of rocks fell on the bay, generating a huge wave that caused a maximum run-up of 524 m on the opposite shore, has been simulated in 3D. The results show that PFEM is a useful tool in risk assessment related with landslides in reservoirs as it gives a good approximation to the potential affections, thus allowing the appropriate design of protection measures. {\textcopyright} 2011 CIMNE (Universitat Polit{\`{e}}cnica de Catalunya).

The collapse of water columns with different initial aspect ratios is simulated by the material point method. In order to test the accuracy and stability of the material point method, simulations are first validated using experimental data and results of mature numerical models. Then, the model is used to ascertain the critical aspect ratio for the widely-used shallow water equations to give satisfactory approximation.

	Abstract = {The book conveys modern techniques and the latest state-of-the-art with regard to the most fundamental aspects of computational contact mechanics. However, since contact can readily be interpreted as a special type of interface problem, it seems advisable not to isolate contact mechanics, but rather to address it in the context of a broader class of problems denoted as computational interface mechanics. The book gives a clear understanding of the underlying physics of interfaces, and a comprehensive insight into the current state-of-the-art and selected cutting-edge research directions in the computational treatment of interface effects. It focuses on the modeling of friction, wear, lubrication, cohesive interfaces, grain boundaries, phase boundaries, fracture, thermo-mechanics and particulate contact (e.g. granular media). Also the most important computational aspects are addressed, including discretization techniques for finite deformations, solution algorithms for single- and multi-processor computing environments, multi-scale approaches, discrete element models and multi-physics problems including contact and interface constraints. Among the computational techniques covered in this book are finite element (FEM) and boundary element (BEM) methods, atomistic models, molecular dynamics (MD), discrete element methods (DEM), coupling approaches for multi-scale simulations, and tools for an efficient automated FEM code generation.

	Abstract = {An implicit material point method (MPM), a variant of the finite element method (FEM), is presented in this paper. The key feature of MPM is that the spatial discretisation uses a set of material points, which are allowed to move freely through the background mesh. All history-dependent variables are tracked on the material points and these material points are used as integration points similar to the Gaussian points. A mapping and re-mapping algorithm is employed, to allow the state variables and other information to be mapped back and forth between the material points and background mesh nodes during an analysis. In contrast to an explicit time integration scheme utilised by most researchers, an implicit time integration scheme has been utilised here. The advantages of such an approach are twofold: firstly, it addresses the limitation of the time step size inherent in explicit integration schemes, thereby potentially saving significant computational costs for certain types of problems; secondly, it enables an improved algorithm accuracy, which is important for some constitutive behaviours, such as elasto-plasticity. The main purpose of this paper is to provide a unified MPM framework, in which both quasi-static and dynamic analyses can be solved, and to demonstrate the model behaviour. The implementation closely follows standard FEM approaches, where possible, to allow easy conversion of other FEM codes. Newton's method is used to solve the equation of motion for both cases, while the formation of the mass matrix and the required updating of the kinematic variables are unique to the dynamic analysis. Comparisons with an Updated Lagrangian FEM and an explicit MPM code are made with respect to the algorithmic accuracy and time step size in a couple of representative examples, which helps to illustrate the relative performance and advantages of the implicit MPM. A geotechnical application is then considered, illustrating the capabilities of the proposed method when applied in the geotechnical field.},

	Abstract = {Challenging solid mechanics problems exist in areas such as geotechnical and biomedical engineering which require numerical methods that can cope with very large deformations, both stretches and torsion. One candidate for these problems is the Material Point Method (MPM), and to deal with stability issues the standard form of the MPM has been developed into new domain-based techniques which change how information is mapped between the computational mesh and the material points. The latest of these developments are the Convected Particle Domain Interpolation (CPDI) approaches. When these are demonstrated, they are typically tested on problems involving large stretch but little torsion and if these MPMs are to be useful for the challenging problems mentioned above, it is important that their capabilities and shortcomings are clear. Here we present a study of the behaviour of some of these MPMs for modelling problems involving large elasto-plastic deformation including distortion. This is carried out in a unified implicit quasi-static computational framework and finds that domain distortion with the CPDI2 approaches affects some solutions and there is a particular issue with one approach. The older CPDI1 approach and the standard MPM however produce physically realistic results. The primary aim of this paper is to raise awareness of the capabilities or otherwise of these domain-based MPMs.},

A relatively accurate constitutive model of soil behaviors should be capable of predicting the elastic and plastic deformations properly. Among a large number of elastoplastic constitutive models developed over the last several decades, constitutive models based on generalized plasticity have been successfully utilized in modeling the mechanical behavior of various soils. This paper attempts to present a review of the most recent developments of generalized plasticity models for geotechnical problems. After a brief review of generalized plasticity theories and constitutive models, limitations of the original Pastor-Zienkiewicz model in practical application are summarized. Afterwards, recent achievements in the generalized plasticity models for both saturated and unsaturated soils and their applicability are analyzed, and a general approach for modification of generalized plasticity models is highlighted.

In addition, LME approximation schemes converge in the Sobolev space W 1,p, i.e., they are C 0-continuous in the conventional terminology of finite-element interpolation. Here we present a generalization of the Local Max-Ent approximation schemes that are consistent to arbitrary order, i.e., interpolate polynomials of arbitrary degree exactly, and which converge in W k,p, i.e., they are C k-continuous to arbitrary order k. We refer to these approximation schemes as High Order Local Maximum-Entropy Approximation Schemes (HOLMES). We prove uniform error bounds for the HOLMES approximates and their derivatives up to order k. Moreover, we show that the HOLMES of order k is dense in the Sobolev space W k,p, for any 1≤p{\textless}∞. The good performance of HOLMES relative to other meshfree schemes in selected test cases is also critically appraised. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

	Abstract = {In many models for disperse two-phase flows, the pressure of the disperse phase is often assumed to be the same as that of the continuous phase, or differ only by an amount caused by the surface tension. This type of model is referred to as an equilibrium pressure model. Recent research indicates that the stress difference between the phases caused by dynamics of the motion can be significantly important in the modeling of disperse two-phase flows. Although this difference is still ignored in most calculations of disperse multiphase flows for various reasons, when an equilibrium pressure model is applied to continuous multiphase flows, a conceptual difficulty arises. For instance, the equilibrium pressure model cannot be used to study the tensile break of a sponge with interconnected pores, because the air in the pores can never go into tension while the sponge material does not break without tension. To avoid this conceptual difficulty, a multipressure model is introduced for continuous multiphase flows by analyzing and then modifying the implicit assumption about the volumetric strain rates involved in the equilibrium pressure model. Numerical implementations of the multipressure model are discussed. An example using the multipressure model is presented.},

@article{Coombs2018,
	Abstract = {Material point methods suffer from volumetric locking when modelling near incompressible materials due to the combination of a low-order computational mesh and large numbers of material points per element. However, large numbers of material points per element are required to reduce integration errors due to non-optimum placement of integration points. This restricts the ability of current material point methods in modelling realistic material behaviour. This paper presents for the first time a method to overcome finite deformation volumetric locking in standard and generalised interpolation material point methods for near-incompressible non-linear solid mechanics. The method does not place any restriction on the form of constitutive model used and is straightforward to implement into existing implicit material point method codes. The performance of the method is demonstrated on a number of two and three-dimensional examples and its correct implementation confirmed through convergence studies towards analytical solutions and by obtaining the correct order of convergence within the global Newton--Raphson equilibrium iterations. In particular, the proposed formulation has been shown to remove the over-stiff volumetric behaviour of conventional material point methods and reduce stress oscillations. It is straightforward to extend this approach to other material point methods and the presented formulation can be incorporated into all existing material point methods available in the literature.},

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, OWZ. This paper presents a computational framework for the numerical analysis of fluid-saturated porous media at large strains. The proposal relies, on one hand, on the particle finite element method (PFEM), known for its capability to tackle large deformations and rapid changing boundaries, and, on the other hand, on constitutive descriptions well established in current geotechnical analyses (Darcy's law; Modified Cam Clay; Houlsby hyperelasticity). An important feature of this kind of problem is that incompressibility may arise either from undrained conditions or as a consequence of material behaviour; incompressibility may lead to volumetric locking of the low-order elements that are typically used in PFEM. In this work, two different three-field mixed formulations for the coupled hydromechanical problem are presented, in which either the effective pressure or the Jacobian are considered as nodal variables, in addition to the solid skeleton displacement and water pressure. Additionally, several mixed formulations are described for the simplified single-phase problem due to its formal similitude to the poromechanical case and its relevance in geotechnics, since it may approximate the saturated soil behaviour under undrained conditions. In order to use equal-order interpolants in displacements and scalar fields, stabilization techniques are used in the mass conservation equation of the biphasic medium and in the rest of scalar equations. Finally, all mixed formulations are assessed in some benchmark problems and their performances are compared. It is found that mixed formulations that have the Jacobian as a nodal variable perform better.},

	Abstract = {Volumetric locking (locking in the incompressible limit) for linear elastic isotropic materials is studied in the context of the element-free Galerkin method. The modal analysis developed here shows that the number of non-physical locking modes is independent of the dilation parameter (support of the interpolation functions). Thus increasing the dilation parameter does not suppress locking. Nevertheless, an increase in the dilation parameter does reduce the energy associated with the non-physical locking modes; thus, in part, it alleviates the locking phenomena. This is shown for linear and quadratic orders of consistency. Moreover, the biquadratic order of consistency, as in finite elements, improves the locking behaviour. Although more locking modes are present in the element-free Galerkin method with quadratic consistency than with standard biquadratic finite elements. Finally, numerical examples are shown to validate the modal analysis. In particular, the conclusions of the modal analysis are also confirmed in an elastoplastic example.},

	Abstract = {Risk associated with landslides of natural or man-made origin depends on the prediction of the post-failure behaviour of the mobilized mass. Numerical models capable of integrating the landslide geometry and its evolution, the coupled hydro mechanical interaction and the soil properties in the context of dynamic forces and large displacements are currently under development. This thesis is a contribution to this effort.

In this sense, the material point method (MPM) is especially suited for analyzing landslides with large displacements. This numerical procedure must be accompanied by tests under controlled conditions in order to accurately check and calibrate the numerical response.

In this thesis the capabilities of the MPM code developed are evaluated through the modelling of scaled laboratory slope tests with large displacements. In order to achieve an adequate comparison of the experimental and numerical results, the experiments are analysed by means of the interpretation of sequential digital images of the movement of the granular medium during the test (PIV technique). A novel procedure is developed to obtain the field of deformations over time and the tracking of particle path in a manner suitable for comparison with numerical results calculated in MPM.

The main objective of the thesis was the development of a comprehensive calculation
tool capable of simulating the behaviour of the slides from the initial triggering to the post-failure phase including thermal effects that determine the evolution of the movement.

A formulation for non-isothermal problems coupled with hydraulic and mechanical
behaviour in MPM was developed and implemented. The formulation includes the dissipation of frictional work as heat, which takes place, mainly, in shear bands. The described phenomena are strongly dependent on the thickness of the shear band and this result in a strong dependence of the numerical results in MPM with the discretization mesh. A novel procedure to solve this problem is presented in this thesis.

Finally, very rapid Vajont landslide (Italy 1963) is modelled. A plain strain 2D model is presented without an ``a priori'' definition of the sliding surface. In fact, in a generalization of previous and recent work, the mobilized materials are not restricted to rigid solids interconnected along a predefined contact surface and the heat generation is not it is limited to a single predefined surface. Thus, thermal interaction processes are developed throughout the model as a function of the location and intensity of deformations.},

	Abstract = {A technique for enforcement of boundary conditions in meshfree methods based on interpolating moving least squares (IMLS) via usage of singular weights for the solution of partial differential equations is presented. Due to the specific singular choice of the weight functions, which is needed to guarantee the interpolation, there is a problem to find the inverse of the singular matrix. We extend the perturbation technique applied to transport equations by Kunle [Entwicklung und Untersuchung von Moving Least Square Verfahren zur numerischen Simulation hydrodynamischer Gleichungen, Dissertation, Fakult{\"{a}}t f{\"{u}}r Physik, Eberhard-Karls-Universit{\"{a}}t zu T{\"{u}}bingen] to allow the correct evaluation of all necessary derivatives for the meshfree collocation solution of boundary value problems in interpolation points at a reasonable cost. The inverse is carried out using the regularized weight function. It turns out that a stable inverse is obtained when the vanishing regularization parameter is considered. The detailed description of this strategy is presented. In contrast to standard kernel functions used in EFGM, RKPM, etc., the singular kernel functions lead to truly interpolating functions which satisfy the Kronecker-delta property and they can therefore be used for enforcement of Dirichlet boundary conditions when solving boundary value problems. As a confirmation of the mathematical derivations we give a solution to a model BVP with a known analytical solution, as well as the experimental convergence study of the method to analytical solutions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

The discrete model of the domain {\&}OHgr; consists of a set of distinct nodes N, and a polygonal description of the boundary ?{\&}OHgr;. In the Natural Element Method, the trial and test functions are constructed using natural neighbour interpolants. These interpolants are based on the Voronoi tessellation of the set of nodes N. The interpolants are smooth (C?) everywhere, except at the nodes where they are C0. In one-dimension, NEM is identical to linear finite elements. The NEM interpolant is strictly linear between adjacent nodes on the boundary of the convex hull, which facilitates imposition of essential boundary conditions. A methodology to model material discontinuities and non-convex bodies (cracks) using NEM is also described. A standard displacement-based Galerkin procedure is used to obtain the discrete system of linear equations. Application of NEM to various problems in solid mechanics, which include, the patch test, gradient problems, bimaterial interface, and a static crack problem are presented. Excellent agreement with exact (analytical) solutions is obtained, which exemplifies the accuracy and robustness of NEM and suggests its potential application in the context of other classes of problems - crack growth, plates, and large deformations to name a few. {\textcopyright} 1998 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

The final relations describing the evolution of the different fields are then obtained in the thermodynamic framework furnished by the principle of maximum plastic dissipation. The particular case of an associated Drucker-Prager model in effective stresses is considered as a model example. A complete characterization of the dissipative structure of the problem of evolution is described through the derivation of an a priori stability estimate. We describe in detail the finite element implementation of the model in the context of staggered algorithms for the solution of the physically coupled problem.

In order to describe process of the explosive welding and accurately predict physical parameters for the explosive welding, numerical simulation of the explosive welding which involves multi-physical phenomenon is performed by using material point method (MPM). Not only can major physical phenomena of explosion impact be well captured, but also some important technical parameters for the explosive welding can be attained based on the MPM simulation.

	Abstract = {We investigate the feasibility of using cohesive theories of fracture, in conjunction with the direct simulation of fracture and fragmentation, in order to describe processes of tensile damage and compressive crushing in concrete specimens subjected to dynamic loading. We account explicitly for microcracking, the development of macroscopic cracks and inertia, and the e ective dynamic behaviour of the material is predicted as an outcome of the calculations. The cohesive properties of the material are assumed to be rate-independent and are therefore determined by static properties such as the static tensile strength. The ability of model to predict the dynamic behaviour of concrete may be traced to the fact that cohesive theories endow the material with an intrinsic time scale. The particular con guration contemplated in this study is the Brazilian cylinder test performed in a Hopkinson bar. Our simulations capture closely the experimentally observed rate sensitivity of the dynamic strength of concrete in the form of a nearly linear increase in dynamic strength with strain rate. More generally, our simulations give accurate transmitted loads over a range of strain rates, which attests to the delity of the model where rate e ects are concerned. The model also predicts key features of the fracture pattern such as the primary lens-shaped cracks parallel to the load plane, as well as the secondary profuse cracking near the supports. The primary cracks are predicted to be nucleated at the centre of the circular bases of the cylinder and to subsequently propagate towards the interior, in accordance with experimental observations. The primary and secondary cracks are responsible for two peaks in the load history, also in keeping with experiment. The results of the simulations also exhibit a size e ect. These results validate the theory as it bears on mixed-mode fracture and fragmentation processes in concrete over a range of strain rates.},

	Abstract = {This article presents a procedure to simulate groundwater flow subject to a nonlinear moving boundary resulting from periodic recharge and significant vertical hydraulic gradients. Under these conditions the Dupuit assumptions are not valid, and the governing equation is an elliptic partial differential equation that reduces to Laplace's equation in homogeneous isotropic aquifers. This equation is subject to a transient nonlinear free-surface boundary condition. To overcome the mathematical difficulties of this boundary-value problem with a nonlinear moving boundary condition, the method of decomposition in combination with successive approximations is proposed. Decomposition series provide a simple systematic approach to the approximate solution of the nonlinear boundary-value problem without linearization or discretization. Components of the decomposition solution are shown to converge fast to an exact solution and are compared with corresponding linearized and finite-difference solutions with good agreement. The model is demonstrated with an application to a perched aquifer in the Jackson Purchase region of Kentucky, which experiences annual fluctuations in the water table of over 5 m and strong vertical gradients. Using bulk values of hydraulic conductivity, an initial condition fitted to heads known at a few piezometers, and a generalized approximate model of periodic mean monthly recharge, approximate expressions for the time-dependent water table, and hydraulic heads are derived and compared with limited measured events. The simplified model reproduced the monthly heads and their seasonal variability. As expected, periodic recharge from rainfall functionally affects the hydraulic head. As a corollary, periodic recharge is imbedded in hydraulic gradients and pore velocities.},

The material point method (MPM) is a numerical technique capable to overcome this limitation. In the present study, MPM is used to carry out a two-dimensional analysis of the run-out process of the Senise landslide that occurred in Southern Italy, in 1986. Accuracy of the method is assessed by comparing the final geometry of the landslide observed just after the event and the magnitude of the measured displacements, to those provided by the numerical simulation. The calculation results match fairly well the observed ones when two slip surfaces detected by the inclinometers, are accounted for in the analysis. An additional improvement of simulation is achieved taking into account the presence of some buildings and retaining walls existing in that area. Kinematics of the landslide is also investigated. The results show that the Senise landslide was a translational slide moving along two planar slip surfaces located in thin layers of clayey silt. In addition, these results demonstrate that a suitable analysis of the post-failure stage can lead to a better understanding of the complex mechanical processes that characterise some landslides, and thereby help in establishing the most effective stabilization measures.},

	Abstract = {In consideration of materials capable of undergoing significant plastic changes in volume, an alternative finite strain hyper-elastoplastic constitutive framework is proposed in terms of the Eshelby stress. Taking a phenomenological point of view, a thermodynamically-consistent approach to developing the constitutive equations is presented and discussed. Various Eshelby-like stresses are defined and shown to be energy-conjugate to the plastic velocity gradient, and a general framework is formulated in the stress-free/plastically-deformed intermediate configuration associated with the multiplicative split of the deformation gradient, as well as the current configuration. A novel Eshelby-like stress measure is proposed, which is scaled by the elastic Jacobian, and is shown to be energy-conjugate to the plastic velocity gradient in the spatial representation. Modified Cam-Clay and Drucker-Prager cap plasticity constitutive equations are introduced, and large strain isotropic compression simulations are performed and compared with experimental measurements. The model results are compared with standard approaches formulated in terms of the Mandel and Kirchhoff stresses, which are shown to require the assumption of isochoric plasticity to satisfy the Clausius Planck inequality (Mandel) and preserve that the intermediate configuration remains stress-free (Kirchhoff). The simulations show that both the material and spatial Eshelby-like stress measures presented here produce the same mean Cauchy stress results; whereas, standard formulations, which make use of isochoric plasticity assumptions, diverge from each other at significant plastic volume strains. Standard formulations are further shown to violate the second law of thermodynamics under certain loading conditions. Calibration of model parameters to high pressure isotropic compression of Boulder clay is used to compare the various models.},

The first is due to the employment of higher-order quadrature rules that leads to an over-constrained discrete system in incompressible problems. The second is associated with the treatment of essential boundary conditions and contact conditions owing to the loss of Kronecker delta properties in the meshfree shape functions. This paper discusses some recent enhancements in meshfree methods for incompressible boundary value problems, carries out numerical convergence analysis, and compares accuracy and efficiency improvement of these methods. Presented methods are a pressure projection method to remedy the over-constrained discrete system, and a mixed transformation method and a boundary singular kernel method for imposition of essential boundary conditions and contact constraints. Several linear and nonlinear problems were analyzed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new approaches.},

In this new methodology, the domain of computation is kept constant, and the free surface is iteratively obtained by imposing impermeability conditions at the free boundaries, which are updated at the end of each iteration, aiming to simulate the physics of the problem. By doing so, a line of pore-water pressure equal to zero (free surface) is obtained in a few iterations, usually two or three. The results obtained with the proposed method have been successfully compared to analytical and numerical solutions in several examples to show the usefulness of the method in practical seepage problems.},

	Abstract = {To overcome the shortcomings of the weakly compressible material point method (WCMPM) for modeling the free surface flow problems, an incompressible material point method (iMPM) is proposed based on operator splitting technique which splits the solution of momentum equation into two steps. An intermediate velocity field is first obtained by solving the momentum equations ignoring the pressure gradient term, and then the intermediate velocity field is corrected by the pressure term to obtain a divergence-free velocity field. A level set function which represents the signed distance to free surface is used to track the free surface and apply the pressure boundary conditions. Moreover, an hourglass damping is introduced to suppress the spurious velocity modes which are caused by the discretization of the cell center velocity divergence from the grid vertexes velocities when solving pressure Poisson equations. Numerical examples including dam break, oscillation of a cubic liquid drop and a droplet impact into deep pool show that the proposed incompressible material point method is much more accurate and efficient than the weakly compressible material point method in solving free surface flow problems.},

The main stress--deformation characteristics of rubberlike solids are thereby exposed. Specific forms of strain-energy function are also reviewed, the role of the Valanis--Landel hypothesis being highlighted. Macroscopic implications of molecular statistical theories are assessed briefly.

	Abstract = {Two elastic-viscoplastic constitutive formulations are evaluated using laboratory and field data from Sackville, New Brunswick and Gloucester, Ontario. Both constitutive models have been implemented in a finite element program and formulated for undrained analysis and fully coupled analysis based on Biot consolidation theory. A laboratory study of the rate-sensitive behaviour of Sackville clay is described. The response of Sackville clay during consolidated anisotropic undrained (CAU) triaxial creep, CAU triaxial compression, and incremental oedometer consolidation is compared with the calculated behaviour. The comparisons demonstrate the general ability of three-parameter elastic-viscoplastic constitutive models to satisfactorily describe the rate-dependent behaviour of Sackville clay. The measured response of Gloucester clay during long-term Rowe cell consolidation tests is compared with the calculated behaviour, and the predictive ability of both constitutive formulations is evaluated using the field performance of the Gloucester case record. In undertaking the present study, the predictive ability of two elastic-viscoplastic constitutive models is examined for two soft clays. A new method of overstress measurement is introduced for elliptical yield surfaces and the importance of adopting a scalable yield surface for the constitutive modeling of soft clay is demonstrated. A model that is suitable for the study of reinforced and unreinforced embankments on soft rate-sensitive clay foundations is identified.},

The double point formulation offers the convenience of allowing for transitions in the flow conditions of the liquid, between free surface flow and groundwater flow. The numerical model is validated by comparing the solid flow velocity with the analytical solution. The influence of the Young's modulus on the solid flow velocity is discussed for both one and two-dimensional analysis cases. The effect of the shape of the two-dimensional solid is investigated. It is shown that the solid stiffness has an effect on the poroelastic flow velocity, due to swelling and bending for the one and two-dimensional cases, respectively. The shape is found to be an important factor on the flow velocity of the poroelastic solid.},

This paper discusses the effect of the stabilization term introduced to the NBNM and examines the convergence of the NBNM approximation. An error indicator for NBNM analysis is proposed, and the development of a prototype CAE system based on this method is outlined.

	Abstract = {The Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) method can be used with advantage in the field of fracture mechanics, which is especially true when quasi-brittle materials are involved. The advantages of the SPH method are more evident when loading speed increases and dynamic material fractures start to occur. Since the SPH method is a meshfree method, the large deformation and eventual fragmentation of material during simulations can be solved without major complications. This happens because of the phase of the SPH method in which a search is made for neighbouring particles and the constraints created between them within a chosen time interval. The number of neighbouring particles depends on the size of the area where the search takes place. This area - the support domain - may therefore be considered as one of the key control elements in simulations using the SPH method. The influence of the number of particles and their initial distribution on the results is also a question. Particle clusters (areas with increased particle concentration) may be formed in cases of poor regularity. Consequently, false (numerical) cracks which bypass these clusters may appear in the simulation. The article describes an experiment concerning the dynamic loading of concrete L-specimens simulated by the SPH method. Different density distributions and initial particle distribution regularities are chosen in the simulation. The results show that it is especially necessary for the initial configuration to exhibit regular particle distribution if simulations are to be executed successfully. False cracks tend to occur more frequently with increasing particle distribution irregularities. A certain degree of compensation can be achieved via the appropriate choice of support domain size with its variations during the simulation.},

	Abstract = {This paper deals with a particular issue of computational mechanics in main FEM codes nowadays available , i.e. the outcomes of implementations of large strain constitutive models based on the adoption of so-called objective stress rates, in order to satisfy objectivity requirements. The point here is that of directly inquiring whether well-known incoherencies due to the adoption of the Zaremba-Jaumann objective stress rate may manifest themselves when the most used elastic and elastoplastic constitutive models are adopted. The present investigation aims at providing a comprehensive review of the theoretical aspects and at developing an informed knowledge to final users of FEM codes, in terms of exposing which constitutive models and FEM implementations may be affected by Zaremba-Jaumann objective stress rate induced incoherencies. Towards this end, local FEM simple shear tests are explored and clearly show that kinematic cases characterized by a non zero spin may be heavily affected by oscillatory incoherencies, which arise for expected cases, i.e. Cauchy stress responses, but also for other less expected cases, i.e. strain responses, whether they are total, elastic or plastic. Beyond local tests, structural simple shear tests are also performed and show as well that oscil-latory incoherencies found in local simple shear tests may heavily influence the overall structural outcomes. A non-secondary target of the paper is that of reviewing the relevant scientific and technical literature about objective stress rates, by critically analyzing correlated issues and proposed solutions, considering scientific contributions spanning over a century, keeping specific attention to the treatment of the Zaremba-Jaumann objective stress rate and to the possible flaws related to its adoption.},

	Abstract = {Modeling seepage along with the mechanical response of deformable Earth dams under transient conditions is a very complicated task, since it involves coupling between different phases, computation of free surface variables in time, and thus it requires algorithms for integration in time. These aspects represent a combination of several problems, which are usually undertaken in a separate way, uncoupling mechanical response and flow through the porous media. When such computations are carried out, most of the times rigid solid skeleton is considered without a comprehensive analysis of the degree of accuracy achieved with such assumptions. Moreover, it is rather difficult to find in the literature coupled formulations under transient conditions. In this paper, a numerical finite element, coupled, transient model for analyzing unconfined seepage through Earth dams is presented. This model is based on Biot's equations, in terms of displacements (so called u-. w formulation). The iterative procedure to obtain free surfaces by changing impermeability boundary conditions is implemented in this model. This generalized model is validated against several cases found in the literature. After that, several relevant aspects of the particular problem of fast emptying of a reservoir, and the calculation of the limiting drawdown speed for not compromising the Earth dam safety, are explored. Thus, the influences of different drawdown speeds, soil permeability values, stiffness and geometries in a theoretical rectangular Earth dam have been analyzed in terms of effective vertical stress changes at relevant points inside the dam. In summary, all these studied cases show the suitability of the presented methodology for evaluating such situations in real Earth dams, and give hints on the more significant aspects to be considered in the Earth dam design. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {For the numerical solution of materially non-linear problems like in computational plasticity or viscoplasticity the finite element discretization in space is usually coupled with point-wise defined evolution equations characterizing the material behaviour. The interpretation of such systems as differential--algebraic equations (DAE) allows modern-day integration algorithms from Numerical Mathematics to be efficiently applied. Especially, the application of diagonally implicit Runge--Kutta methods (DIRK) together with a Multilevel-Newton method preserves the algorithmic structure of current finite element implementations which are based on the principle of virtual displacements and on backward Euler schemes for the local time integration. Moreover, the notion of the consistent tangent operator becomes more obvious in this context. The quadratical order of convergence of the Multilevel-Newton algorithm is usually validated by numerical studies. However, an analytical proof of this second order convergence has already been given by authors in the field of non-linear electrical networks. We show that this proof can be applied in the current context based on the DAE interpretation mentioned above. We finally compare the proposed procedure to several well-known stress algorithms and show that the inclusion of a step-size control based on local error estimations merely requires a small extra time-investment.

	Abstract = {Many finite element programs including standard commercial software such as ABAQUS use an incremental finite strain formula- tion that is not fully work-conjugate, i.e., the work of stress incre- ments on the strain increments does not give a second-order ac- curate expression for work. In particular, the stress increments based on the Jaumann rate of Kirchhoff stress are work-conjugate with the increments of the Hencky (logarithmic) strain tensor but are paired in many finite element programs with the increments of Green's Lagrangian strain tensor. Although this problem was pointed out as early 1971, a demonstration of its significance in realistic situations has been lacking. Here it is shown that, in buckling of compressed highly orthotropic columns or sandwich columns that are very ``soft'' in shear, the use of such nonconju- gate stress and strain increments can cause large errors, as high as 100{\%} of the critical load, even if the strains are small. A similar situation may arise when severe damage such as distrib- uted cracking leads to a highly anisotropic tangential stiffness matrix, or when axial cracks between fibers severely weaken a uniaxial fiber composite or wood. A revision of these finite element programs is advisable, and will in fact be easy---it will suffice to replace the Jaumann rate with the Truesdell rate. Alternatively, the Green's Lagrangian strain could be replaced with the Hencky strain.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a new technique which allows the use of simplex finite elements (linear triangles in 2D and linear tetrahedra in 3D) in the large strain analysis of nearly incompressible solids. The new technique extends the F-bar method proposed by de Souza Neto et al. (Int. J. Solids and Struct. 1996; 33: 3277--3296) and is conceptually very simple: It relies on the enforcement of (near-) incompressibility over a patch of simplex elements (rather than the point-wise enforcement of conventional displacement-based finite elements). Within the framework of the F-bar method, this is achieved by assuming, for each element of a mesh, a modified (F-bar) deformation gradient whose volumetric component is defined as the volume change ratio of a pre-defined patch of elements. The resulting constraint relaxation effectively overcomes volumetric locking and allows the successful use of simplex elements under finite strain near-incompressibility. As the original F-bar procedure, the present methodology preserves the displacement-based structure of the finite element equations as well as the strain-driven format of standard algorithms for numerical integration of path-dependent constitutive equations and can be used regardless of the constitutive model adopted. The new elements are implemented within an implicit quasi-static environment. In this context, a closed form expression for the exact tangent stiffness of the new elements is derived. This allows the use of the full Newton--Raphson scheme for equilibrium iterations. The performance of the proposed elements is assessed by means of a comprehensive set of benchmarking two- and three-dimensional numerical examples.},

The free boundary is located from a fixed mesh solution in which the required constraints are imposed by penalization of the variational equation. Central to the efficiency of the algorithm is the use of a 'relaxed penalty function' which makes it possible to linearize the penalized equation consistently. The solution is shown to converge orders of magnitude faster than some of the most widely used algorithms for solving free-boundary problems associated with flow of fluids through porous media. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

	Abstract = {The compressional wave of the second king which was predicted theoretically by Biot (1956a) was observed in granular soils using very sensitive transducers. The Biot theory models both the individual and coupled behaviour of soil skeleton and pore fluid using the permeability, porosity, viscosity, densities and appropriate elastic constants of the solid, pore fluid and solid skeleton. The measured Biot-wave velocities agree well with the theoretical values computed using properties and parameters which were obtained primarily from laboratory tests. The good agreement demonstrates that the Biot theory is valid for granular soils. The propagation of the P- and S-waves in granular materials was measured under different confining pressures and in both dry and saturated conditions. An empirical relationship between shear modulus G (in kPa) and confining pressure $\sigma$c(in kPa) for Monterey sand and crystal silica sand samples was found to be given by G=1{\textperiodcentered}10($\sigma$c)0.42∼ 1{\textperiodcentered}64($\sigma$c)0.46. The measured Poisson's ratio of the soil skeleton is in the range 0{\textperiodcentered}323-0{\textperiodcentered}418, and it decreases as the confining pressure increases. The results of theoretical studies of the effect of frequency on wave velocities and ihr influences of other parameters are also presented.},

	Abstract = {A material point method (MPM)/generalized interpolation material point method (GIMP) with enriched shape function (EMPM/EGIMP for short) is proposed for modelling crack problems in the MPM/GIMP framework. The EMPM/EGIMP enriches the nodal degrees of freedom based on the idea of the extended finite element method (XFEM). This improvement allows the crack problem, whose displacement and velocity are discontinuous, to be simulated by only one set of background grid meshes, so multigrid and multiple velocity fields are unnecessary. In addition, the technique we developed to lump the mass matrix makes the EMPM/EGIMP can be implemented easily in a conventional MPM/GIMP code. If there is no crack, the EMPM/EGIMP degenerates to the conventional MPM/GIMP. The Level Set Method (LSM) is employed in the EMPM/EGIMP for easily tracking crack surfaces. The crack moves with the material points physically, so that the LSM function is carried by particles. In each time step, the LSM function value is mapped to the grid nodes from the particles, and the nodes to be enriched can be identified conveniently from the grid nodal LSM function values. Numerical experiments for stress fields distribution, fracture parameters calculation and crack propagation are provided to validate the proposed EMPM/EGIMP.},

@article{Peruzzo2019,
	Abstract = {Analytical solutions and a vast majority of numerical ones for fracture propagation in saturated porous media yield smooth behavior while experiments, field observations and a few numerical solutions reveal stepwise crack advancement and pressure oscillations. To explain this fact, we invoke self-organization of rupture observed in fracturing solids, both dry and fully saturated, when two requirements are satisfied: i) the external drive has a much slower timescale than fracture propagation; and ii) the increment of the external load (drive) is applied only when the internal rearrangement of fracture is over. These requirements are needed to obtain clean Self Organized Criticality (SOC) in quasi-static situations. They imply that there should be no restriction on the fracture velocity i.e. algorithmically the fracture advancement rule should always be independent of the crack velocity. Generally, this is not the case when smooth answers are obtained which are often unphysical. Under the above conditions hints of Self Organized Criticality are evident in heterogeneous porous media in quasi-static conditions using a lattice model, showing stepwise advancement of the fracture and pressure oscillations. We extend this model to incorporate inertia forces and show that this behavior still holds. By incorporating the above requirements in numerical fracture advancement algorithms for cohesive fracture in saturated porous continua we also reproduce stepwise advancements and pressure oscillations both in quasi-static and dynamic situations. Since dynamic tests of dry specimens show that the fracture advancement velocity is not constant we replicate such an effect with a model of a debonding beam on elastic foundation. This is the first step before introducing the interaction with a fluid.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new time-stepping algorithm for frictional contact problems that exhibits unconditional positive energy dissipation. More specifically, the proposed scheme preserves a priori stability estimates of the continuum problem for both frictionless and frictional contact, leading to improved numerical stability properties in particular. For the normal contact component, the algorithm exhibits full energy conservation between released states, while the energy does not increase over its initial value due to the enforcement of the normal contact constraint during persistent contact. A penalty regularization is considered to this purpose. A new regularization of the stick conditions is considered for the frictional part. The new scheme is shown rigorously to exhibit positive energy dissipation like the continuum physical problem in this frictional case. Coulomb friction is assumed. Complete analyses of these considerations, as well as a detailed description of their finite element implementation, are included in the general finite deformation range. Representative numerical simulations are presented to assess the performance of the newly proposed methods. {\textcopyright} 1999 Elsevier Science S.A.},

	Abstract = {Traditional geotechnical analyses for landslides involve failure prediction (i.e. onset of failure) and the design of structures that can safely withstand the applied loads. The analyses provide limited information on the post-failure behaviour. Modern numerical methods are able to simulate large mass movements and there is an opportunity to utilise such methods to evaluate the risks of catastrophic damage if a landslide occurs. In this paper, various large-deformation analysis methods are introduced and their applicability for solving landslide problems is discussed. Since catastrophic landslides often involve seepage forces, consideration of the coupled behaviour of soil and pore fluid is essential. Two approaches to model soil--pore fluid coupling in large-deformation analysis using the material point method (MPM) are introduced. An example simulation is presented for each approach; one on a model levee failure and the other on a natural cut slope failure (the Selborne experiment conducted by Cooper and...},

Specifically, wet or dense snow that has both solid- and fluid-like properties is difficult to handle. Consequently, this pa- per presents a novel snow simulation method utilizing a user- controllable elasto-plastic constitutive model integrated with a hy- brid Eulerian/Lagrangian Material Point Method. The method is continuum based and its hybrid nature allows us to use a regular Cartesian grid to automate treatment of self-collision and fracture. It also naturally allows us to derive a grid-based semi-implicit in- tegration scheme that has conditioning independent of the number of Lagrangian particles. We demonstrate the power of our method with a variety of snow phenomena including complex character in- teractions.},

	Abstract = {The authors describe a theoretical model and kinematic approach suitable for the numerical analysis of problems at large deformation finite strains and rotations. The presented formulations are implemented incrementally with a non-linear and rate-dependent constitutive model, adequate to the simulation of high temperature processes. The large deformation kinematic model is based on the additive decomposition of the transformation gradient and the strain rate tensor in thermoelastic and viscoplastic parts. Stress-strain relations leading to the constitutive equations governing finite deformations are formulated on an unrotated frame of reference. These relations are obtained either by polar decomposition of the transformation gradient or by the rotation increment method. Both approaches and algorithms are thoroughly compared and discussed. The flow rule is a function of the equivalent stress and the deviatoric stress tensor, of the temperature field and of a set of internal state variables. The increments of the state variables are calculated with a forward gradient time integration procedure, based on a numerical estimation of the integral of the strain rate tensor. The model was implemented in a three-dimensional finite element code and tested with a set of tensile and shear tests on aluminium alloy specimens. In order to evaluate the performance of the numerical algorithms with elevated temperature processes, tests were done at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 580 K. Numerical simulation results are compared with experimental results and shown to be in good agreement. Real material behaviour is fairly well predicted and matches the experimental results obtained with different loading conditions at different temperatures. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

The field variables of each material point (including velocity and stress) are re-calculated by one smoothed reconstruction procedure, while the rest of the solution steps are the same as those in the original MPM algorithm. In this preliminary study, the numerical performances of the original MPM, SPH and the SMPM are examined and compared using one-dimensional transient problems including impact. It is demonstrated that the numerical oscillations can be effectively reduced by the proposed reconstruction, showing the superiority of the SMPM over the original MPM and SPH in terms of solution accuracy and stability. As compared with the SPH, the SMPM exhibits significantly higher efficiency. Numerical results also illustrate that the proposed SMPM possesses the advantages of both the MPM and the SPH, which warrants the further development of the SMPM for general applications.},

	Abstract = {Simple Finite Element models for soil dynamics and earthquake engineering problems in the frequency domain are a fast and valuable tool providing a first approximation before a full non-linear analysis in the time domain is performed. Quite often the problem concerns saturated soils with very small permeability and pore fluid of neglectable compressibility. In the limit, the permeability is assumed to be zero and the pore fluid incompressible. Here, engineers use standard finite element codes formulated in terms of displacements but incompressibility may result in volumetric locking of the mesh with a severe loss of accuracy. The purpose of this paper is to present a simple mixed finite element formulation in the frequency domain based on displacements and pore pressures as main variables. A suitable stabilization technique allowing for equal order interpolation of displacements and pressures has been introduced for incompressible and zero permeability limits. Of course, the range of application is limited to those problems in which the behaviour of the material can be approximated by linear models, and therefore modelling of phenomena such as liquefaction, cyclic mobility or cavitation occur is excluded. The paper shows as well an extremely simple way of coupling solid and water domains as it occurs for instance in quay walls under dynamic loading. {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science Limited.

This gives rise to the first space--time multigrid solver for poroelasticity equations in the literature. The waveform relaxation iteration is based on a point-wise Vanka smoother that couples the pressure variable at a grid-point with the displacements around it. A semi-algebraic mode analysis is proposed to theoretically analyze the convergence of the multigrid waveform relaxation algorithm. This analysis is novel since it combines the semi-algebraic analysis, suitable for parabolic problems, with the non-standard analysis for overlapping smoothers. The practical utility of the method is illustrated through several numerical experiments in one and two dimensions.},

These methods come in various favors, most of which can be explained either by what is known in the literature as radial basis functions (RBFs), or in terms of the moving least squares (MLS) method. Over the past several years meshfree approximation methods have found their way into many different application areas ranging from artifcial intelligence, computer graphics, image processing and optimization to the numerical solution of all kinds of (partial) differential equations problems. Applications in computational nanotechnology are still somewhat rare, but do exist in the literature. In this chapter we will focus on the mathematical foundation of meshfree methods, and the discussion of various computational techniques presently available for a successful implementation of meshfree methods. At the end of this review we mention some initial applications of meshfree methods to problems in computational nanotechnology, and hope that this introduction will serve as a motivation for others to apply meshfree methods to many other challenging problems in computational nanotechnology.},

	Abstract = {The material point method (MPM) has been increasingly used for the simulation of large deformation processes in fluid-infiltrated porous materials. For undrained poromechanical problems, however, standard MPMs are numerically unstable because they use low-order interpolation functions that violate the inf-sup stability condition. In this work, we develop stabilized MPM formulations for dynamic and quasi-static poromechanics that permit the use of standard low-order interpolation functions notwithstanding the drainage condition. For the stabilization of both dynamic and quasi-static formulations, we utilize the polynomial pressure projection method whereby a stabilization term is augmented to the balance of mass. The stabilization term can be implemented with both the original and generalized interpolation material point (GIMP) methods, and it is compatible with existing time-integration methods. Here we use fully-implicit methods for both dynamic and quasi-static poromechanical problems, aided by a block-preconditioned Newton-Krylov solver. The stabilized MPMs are verified and investigated through several numerical examples under dynamic and quasi-static conditions. Results show that the proposed MPM formulations allow standard low-order interpolation functions to be used for both the solid displacement and pore pressure fields of poromechanical formulations, from undrained to drained conditions, and from dynamic to quasi-static conditions.},

	Abstract = {Many civil engineering projects are related to hydro-mechanical behavior of unsaturated expansive soils over a wide suction range, which was investigated by imposing suctions on an expansive soil using the axis-translation technique and the vapor equilibrium technique with saturated salt solution in this paper. Water retention test results on compacted expansive soil show that void ratio keeps decreasing along with increasing the suction in an entire suction range (from 0 to about 1000 MPa), and the soil--water retention curves in terms of gravimetric water content versus suction relation are independent of the dry density or void ratio when the suction is higher than 250 kPa. Therefore, the mechanical tests on an unsaturated expansive soil with constant water content can be considered as that at constant suction when suction is higher than 250 kPa. The stress--strain behavior at different constant suctions in the entire suction range measured from triaxial shear tests under a constant net confining stress shows that the strength and stress--strain curve of specimens with higher suction are higher than those with lower suction and the higher the suction, the more dilative the specimens. The strain softening appears when the suction is higher than a specific value and the appearance of strain softening is related to the sliding surface. The tested compacted expansive soil with extremely high suctions (i.e., 38.0 and 368 MPa) shows distinct peak strength, strain-softening and dilative behavior.},

	Abstract = {Potentially, a seabed may be characterized rapidly and economically by using dynamically installed free-falling penetrometers (FFPs). Because of their relatively rapid deployment and recovery, FFPs may be preferred over conventional full-flow or cone penetrometers for characterizing seabeds. However, despite several successful field trials of FFPs, significant uncertainty still exists about the data interpretation, mainly because of the fast nature of the penetration process, during which regions of the soil body close to the penetrometer experience very high strain rates. The consequence of such high strain rates on pore pressure measurement is not well known. Furthermore, the rigorous numerical analysis of the problem is notoriously difficult because it involves large deformations, dynamics, hydrodynamic coupling, highly nonlinear material behavior, rate dependency, and contact mechanics. A finite-element procedure was developed and used in this study to provide a dynamic coupled solution for the penetrometer impact and burial into saturated clay. Subsequently, some mechanisms involved in the generation of excess pore pressures were investigated with specific attention given to the effects of the penetrometer tip geometry and the location of the pore pressure measuring devices. An important numerical challenge in modeling this problem is highlighted in this paper. It concerns the numerical diffusion that can occur because of the remeshing process required in this large deformation, moving boundary problem. (C) 2018 American Society of Civil Engineers.},

	Abstract = {Crack fronts play a fundamental role in engineering models for fracture: they are the location of both crack growth and the energy dissipation due to growth. However, there has not been a rigorous mathematical definition of crack front, nor rigorous mathematical analysis predicting fracture paths using these fronts as the location of growth and dissipation. Here, we give a natural weak definition of crack front and front speed, and consider models of crack growth in which the energy dissipation is a function of the front speed, that is, the dissipation rate at time t is of the form integral(F(t)) psi(nu(x, t))dH(N-2)(x) where F(t) is the front at time t and nu is the front speed. We show how this dissipation can be used within existing models of quasi-static fracture, as well as in the new dissipation functionals of Mielke-Ortiz. An example of a constrained problem for which there is existence is shown, but in general, if there are no constraints or other energy penalties, this dissipation must be relaxed. We prove a general relaxation formula that gives the surprising result that the effective dissipation is always rate-independent.},

It is shown that the Lagrangian velocity constraint method achieves energy conservation and a zero gap constraint approximately, where the errors can be reduced by temporal refinement. In addition to this, a regularised penalty force is devised to ensure exact energy conservation for frictionless contact analysis using the trapezoidal rule. Therefore, unlike the conventional penalty method, the proposed method achieves better accuracy in the impenetrability constraint whilst maintaining the energy stability with no need for extra refinement of the temporal discretisation. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {In this work, a three-node triangular finite element with two degrees of freedom per node for the large strain elasto-plastic analysis of axisymmetric solids is presented. The formulation resorts to the adjacent elements to obtain a quadratic interpolation of the geometry over a patch of four elements from which an average deformation gradient is defined. Thus, the element formulation falls within the framework of assumed strain elements or more precisely of F-bar type formulations. The in-plane behavior of the element is similar to the linear strain triangle, but without the drawbacks of the quadratic triangle, e.g. contact or distortion sensitivity. The element does not suffer of volumetric locking in problems with isochoric plastic flow and the implementation is simple. It has been implemented in a finite element code with explicit time integration of the momentum equations and tools that allow the simulation of industrial processes. The widely accepted multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient in elastic and plastic components is adopted here. An isotropic material with non-linear isotropic hardening has been considered. Two versions of the element have been implemented based on a Total and an Updated Lagrangian Formulation, respectively. Some approximations have been considered in the latter formulation aimed to reduce the number of operations in order to increase numerical efficiency. To consider bulk forming, with large geometric changes, an automatic local remeshing strategy has been developed. Several examples are considered to assess the element performance with and without remeshing. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

The mixed transformation method is modified from the previous full transformation method by introducing a node partitioning and a mixed coordinate so that the matrix inversion and multiplication of coordinate transformation involves operations only on the sub-degrees of freedom associated with the boundary group. The boundary singular kernel method introduces singularities to the kernel functions of the essential and contact boundary nodes so that the corresponding coefficients of the singular kernel shape functions recover nodal values, and consequently kinematic constraints can be imposed directly.

	Abstract = {Phenomena involving general solid--water interactions such as flows with debris are challenging to model numerically because they are not easily represented using solid- or fluid-oriented methods. The material point method (MPM) provides a unified multi-material interaction platform potentially capable of modeling complex solid--water flow phenomena. However, it is necessary to address volumetric locking for (nearly) incompressible materials when modeling fluids, while also stabilizing integration errors that arise in standard MPM. This paper examines these challenges in depth, and presents a flux-based smoothing algorithm designed to address integration-error-induced destabilization via controlled strain energy dissipation. The effectiveness of the algorithm is demonstrated with two simple but fundamental fluid/solid problems, and with an application to a complex solid--water dynamic interaction problem. Results show the flux-based smoothing algorithm is capable of stabilizing the side-effects of numerical integration errors, while at the same time remaining inactive if there is no integration-error-induced oscillation. Based on this study, the flux-based smoothing algorithm is suggested as a stabilization scheme for MPM when using constant-interpolated hybrid elements.},

	Abstract = {Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of elastic solids and viscous fluids may suffer from unphysical clustering of particles due to the tensile instability. Recent work has shown that in simulations of elastic or brittle solids the instability can be removed by an artificial stress whose form is derived from a linear perturbation analysis of the full set of governing SPH equations. While a linear analysis cannot be used to derive the corresponding form of the artificial stress for a viscous fluid, here we show that the same construction which applies to elastic solids may also work for viscous fluids provided that the constant parameter $\epsilon$ entering in the definition of the artificial stress is properly chosen. As a suitable test case, we model the formation of a circular van der Waals liquid drop and show that the tensile instability is removed when an artificial viscous force and energy generation term are added to the standard SPH equations of motion and energy, respectively.

@article{Rogers1957,
	Abstract = {The statistical mechanics of Gibbs is a juxtaposition of subjective, probabilistic ideas on the one hand and objective, mechanical ideas on the other. In this paper, we follow the path set out by Jaynes, including elements added subsequently to that original work, to explore the consequences of the purely statistical point of view. We show how standard methods in the equilibrium theory could have been derived simply from a description of the available problem information. In addition, our presentation leads to novel insights into questions associated with symmetry and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics. Two surprising consequences to be explored in further work are that (in)distinguishability factors are automatically predicted from the problem formulation and that a quantity related to the thermodynamic entropy production is found by considering information loss in non-equilibrium processes. Using the problem of ion channel thermodynamics as an example, we illustrate the idea of building up complexity by successively adding information to create progressively more complex descriptions of a physical system. Our result is that such statistical mechanical descriptions can be used to create transparent, computable, experimentally-relevant models that may be informed by more detailed atomistic simulations. We also derive a theory for the kinetic behavior of this system, identifying the nonequilibrium `process' free energy functional. The Gibbs relation for this functional is a fluctuation-dissipation theorem applicable arbitrarily far from equilibrium, that captures the effect of non-local and time-dependent behavior from transient driving forces. Based on this work, it is clear that statistical mechanics is a general tool for constructing the relationships between constraints on system information.},

This is done by using Onsager's principle, and introducing generalized concepts of free energy and thermodynamic potentials. From these equations it is shown that the instantaneous evolution of the system satisfies a principle of minimum rate of entropy production. It is also shown how Prigogine's theorem for the stationary state fits into the present theory. Another variational principle is established for the case where certain variables are ignored in analogy with the methods of virtual work in mechanics. This principle which applies to complex physical-chemical systems is developed more specifically for viscoelastic phenomena, and as an example the differential equations for the deflection of a viscoelastic plate is derived.},

	Abstract = {The present work shows the application of a new methodology, to find out the free surface inside earth fill dams under steady flow conditions, to a real field case: the Gasset Dam, in Ciudad Real, Spain. An accurate and fast computation of the free surface is of paramount importance, since it is a previous and necessary step for evaluating the safety of an earth dam in terms of its stress-strain behavior. This new methodology is based on a coupled numerical model formulated in terms of displacements (so called u- w formulation) instead of a more usual approach of water heads. The developed general code has been previously validated using several theoretical seepage problems through porous media. The selected field case is an earth dam built a century ago, which has been subjected to several rehabilitation works since then. Hence, it is a very irregular and nonhomogeneous dam. The comparison of computations and real field measurements, in terms of the free surface location and the total discharge through the dam under steady conditions, is presented in this paper, demonstrating the accuracy and applicability of this formulation to this kind of problems. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

The combination of conventional SPH and a mixed-mode cohesive model allows capturing fracture and separation under various loading conditions efficiently. The key advantage of this framework is its capability to represent complex fracture geometries by a set of cracked SPH particles, each of which can possess its own mixed-mode cohesive fracture with arbitrary orientations. Therefore, this can naturally capture complex fracture patterns without any predefined fracture topologies. Because a characteristic length scale related to the size of the fracture process zone is incorporated in the constitutive formulation, the proposed approach is independent from the spatial discretisation of the computational domain (or mesh independent). Furthermore, the anisotropic fracture responses of materials can be naturally captured thanks to the orientation of the fracture process zone embedded at the particle level. The performance of the proposed approach demonstrates its potentials in modelling mixed-mode fracture of rocks and similar quasi-brittle materials.},

	Abstract = {The Paper presents a constitutive model for describing the stress-strain behaviour of partially saturated soils. The model is formulated within the framework of hardening plasticity using two independent sets of stress variables: the excess of total stress over air pressure and the suction. The model is able to represent, in a consistent and unified manner, many of the fundamental features of the behaviour of partially saturated soils which had been treated separately by previously proposed models. On reaching saturation, the model becomes a conventional critical state model. Because experimental evidence is still limited, the model has been kept as simple as possible in order to provide a basic framework from which extensions are possible. The model is intended for partially saturated soils which are slightly or moderately expansive. After formulating the model for isotropic and triaxial stress states, typical predictions are described and compared, in a qualitative way, with characteristic trends of the behaviour of partially saturated soils. Afterwards, the results of a number of suction-controlled laboratory tests on compacted kaolin and a sandy clay are used to evaluate the ability of the model to reproduce, quantitatively, observed behaviour. The agreement between observed and computed results is considered satisfactory and confirms the possibilities of reproducing the most important features of partially saturated soil behaviour using a simple general framework. $\backslash$n L'article pr{\'{e}}sente un mod{\`{e}}le constitutif pour d{\'{e}}crire le comportement contrainte/d{\'{e}}formation des sols partiellement satur{\'{e}}s.

	Abstract = {We present a one-parameter family of approximation schemes, which we refer to as local maximum-entropy approximation schemes, that bridges continuously two important limits: Delaunay triangulation and maximum-entropy (max-ent) statistical inference. Local max-ent approximation schemes represent a compromise---in the sense of Pareto optimality---between the competing objectives of unbiased statistical inference from the nodal data and the definition of local shape functions of least width. Local max-ent approximation schemes are entirely defined by the node set and the domain of analysis, and the shape functions are positive, interpolate affine functions exactly, and have a weak Kronecker-delta property at the boundary. Local max-ent approximation may be regarded as a regularization, or thermalization, of Delaunay triangulation which effectively resolves the degenerate cases resulting from the lack or uniqueness of the triangulation. Local max-ent approximation schemes can be taken as a convenient basis for the numerical solution of PDEs in the style of meshfree Galerkin methods. In test cases characterized by smooth solutions we find that the accuracy of local max-ent approximation schemes is vastly superior to that of finite elements.

In the present paper, we extend the formulation to unsaturated porous media and investigate the effect of spatially varying degree of saturation on triggering a shear band in granular materials. Variational formulations are presented for porous solids whose voids are filled with liquid and gas. Two critical state formulations are used to characterize the solid constitutive response: one developed for clay and another for sand. Stabilized low-order mixed finite elements are used to solve the fully coupled solid-deformation/fluid-flow problem. For the first time, we present the consistent derivative of the effective stress tensor with respect to capillary pressure considering full coupling of solid deformation with fluid flow, which is essential for achieving an optimal convergence rate of Newton iteration. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {In this work, we employ both the state-based peridynamics and the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate soil fragmentation/ejection induced by the blast of buried explosives. We use peridynamics representation to model soil medium, and we use SPH representation to model explosive gas. The key of the simulation is the coupling of the two. In the peridynamics-SPH computational domain, there is an interphase zone, in which a peridynamic particle can have SPH particles within its own horizon, while an SPH particle can have peridynamic particles within its supporting domain. The interactions of the peridynamic and SPH particles in this interphase zone are discussed. By assuming the equivalence of the two methods in the current configuration, we study how to choose simulation parameters that can seamlessly couple the two methods. A Drucker-Prager plasticity soil model at finite strain is used for soil medium and a charge model of equation of state is used to model the buried explosive. Numerical examples are carried out to simulate soil fragmentation/ejection induced by the shock waves from the buried explosive. It is shown that the numerical results are in general agreement with that of the experiment.},

After its definition, the new function will be compared with different yield surfaces existing in literature in both the deviatoric and the meridian representation.

	Abstract = {Internal erosion is a general term referring to the mechanism of detachment and movement of soil grains due to water flow through a porous media. It includes many different processes such as piping, soil contact erosion, or suffusion. The study and prediction of these complex phenomena is a recurrent topic in many different fields such as geotechnics, hydraulic and hydrocarbon engineering. This is because internal erosion is one of the main causes of failure of water retaining structures such as dikes and dams. This process also controls the amount of sand production in oil-producing wells. In many cases, such instabilities are related to large deformation of the material involved. The goal of this study is to present a first approach using the Material Point Method to model internal erosion process that occurs in bimodal internally unstable soils. These type of soils consist of a mixture of coarse and fine grains, in which the coarse fraction forms the stable skeleton of the soil, whilst fine grains can be eroded and are able to move freely as a result of seepage flow. The results of a simple numerical test consisting of a soil column subjected to a vertical flow of water are presented. It can be seen that fine fraction is eroded from the solid skeleton depending on the erosion law, and it transported as fluidised material through the saturated porous media.},

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s). Simulating the physical behaviors of deformable objects and fluids has been an important topic in computer graphics. While the Lagrangian Finite Element Method (FEM) is widely used for elasto-plastic solids, it usually requires additional computational components in the case of large deformation, mesh distortion, fracture, self-collision and coupling between materials. Often, special solvers and strategies need to be developed for a particular problem. Recently, the hybrid Eulerian/Lagrangian Material Point Method (MPM) was introduced to the graphics community. It uses a continuum description of the governing equations and utilizes user-controllable elasto-plastic constitutive models. The hybrid nature of MPM allows using a regular Cartesian grid to automate treatment of self-collision and fracture. Like other particle methods such as Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH), topology change is easy due to the lack of explicit connectivity between Lagrangian particles. Furthermore, MPM allows a grid-based implicit integration scheme that has conditioning independent of the number of Lagrangian particles. MPM also provides a unified particle simulation framework similar to Position Based Dynamics (PBD) for easy coupling of different materials. The power of MPM has been demonstrated in a number of recent papers for simulating various materials including elastic objects, snow, lava, sand and viscoelastic fluids. It is also highly integrated into the production framework of Walt Disney Animation Studios and has been used in featured animations including Frozen, Big Hero 6 and Zootopia.},

	Abstract = {Natural geomaterials often exhibit pore size distributions with two dominant porosity scales. Examples include fractured rocks where the dominant porosities are those of the fractures and rock matrix, and aggregated soils where the dominant porosities are those of the micropores and macropores. We develop a constitutive framework for this type of materials that covers both steady-state and transient fluid flow responses. The framework relies on a thermodynamically consistent effective stress previously developed for porous media with two dominant porosity scales. We show that this effective stress is equivalent to the weighted sum of the individual effective stresses in the micropores and macropores, with the weighting done according to the pore fractions. This partitioning of the effective stress into two single-porosity effective stresses allows fluid pressure dissipation at the macropores and micropores to be considered separately, with important implications for individual characterization of the hardening responses at the two pore scales. Experimental data suggest that the constitutive framework captures the laboratory responses of aggregated soils more accurately than other models previously reported in the literature. Numerical simulations of boundary-value problems reveal the capability of the framework to capture the effect of secondary compression as the micropores discharge fluids into the macropores.},

	Abstract = {The granular column collapse is a well-established experiment which consists of having a vertical column of granular material on a flat surface and letting it collapse by gravity. Despite its simplicity in execution, the numerical modelling of a column collapse remains challenging. So far, much attention has been dedicated in assessing the ability of various numerical methods in modelling the large deformation and little to the role of the constitutive model on both the triggering mechanism and the flow behaviour. Furthermore, the influence of the initial density, and its associated dilatancy and strength characteristics, have never been included in the analyses. Most past numerical investigations had relied on simple constitutive relations which do not consider the softening behaviours. The aim of this study is to illustrate the influence of the constitutive model on the on-set of failure, the flow behaviour and the deposition profile using the material point method. Three constitutive models were used to simulate the collapse of two granular columns with different geometries and for two densities. The results of the simulations showed that the constitutive model had a twofold influence on the collapse behaviour. It defined the volume of the mobilised mass which spread along the flat surface and controlled the dissipation of its energy. The initial density was found to enhance the failure angle and flow behaviours and was more significant for small columns than for larger ones. The analysis of the potential energy of the mobilised mass explained the existence of two collapse regimes.},

	Abstract = {The material point method (MPM) has demonstrated itself as a computationally effective particle method for solving solid mechanics problems involving large deformations and/or fragmentation of structures, which are sometimes problematic for finite element methods (FEMs). However, similar to most methods that employ mixed Lagrangian (particle) and Eulerian strategies, analysis of the method is not straightforward. The lack of an analysis framework for MPM, as is found in FEMs, makes it challenging to explain anomalies found in its employment and makes it difficult to propose methodology improvements with predictable outcomes. In this paper we present an analysis of the quadrature errors found in the computation of (material) internal force in MPM and use this analysis to direct proposed improvements. In particular, we demonstrate that lack of regularity in the grid functions used for representing the solution to the equations of motion can hamper spatial convergence of the method. We propose the use of a quadratic B-spline basis for representing solutions on the grid, and we demonstrate computationally and explain theoretically why such a small change can have a significant impact on the reduction in the internal force quadrature error (and corresponding 'grid crossing error') often experienced when using MPM.

	Abstract = {Mesh rezoning is essential in some finite element analyses. Of the existing techniques, inverse isoparametric mapping (x, y) → ($\epsilon$$\eta$) is a mathematically sound and accurate approach. A survey of existing techniques reveals that the predefined line technique proposed by Murti and Valliappan [Comput. Structures 22, 1011-1021 (1986)] is the most efficient for quadratic elements. A new, robust and more efficient implementation of the predefined line technique is presented in tins paper. Extensions of the technique to encompass triangles and collapsed quadrilaterals are described. A detailed examination of its solution convergence rate and its dependence on element distortion is conducted to better understand the technique's performance. Its implementation for other than quadratic elements is also outlined. A numerical example is included to demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of this improved technique. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

Additionally, it enables a new stress divergence discretization that effortlessly allows all MPM simulations to run two times faster than before. We also develop a Compatible Particle-In-Cell (CPIC) algorithm on top of MLS-MPM. Utilizing a colored distance field representation and a novel compatibility condition for particles and grid nodes, our framework enables the simulation of various new phenomena that are not previously supported by MPM, including material cutting, dynamic open boundaries, and two-way coupling with rigid bodies. MLS-MPM with CPIC is easy to implement and friendly to performance optimization.},

	Abstract = {Ploughing of the seabed is needed for the installation of cables and pipelines and is an area of construction likely to increase given plans in the UK and elsewhere for offshore marine energy (wind and tidal). Seabed ploughing is an expensive and sometimes risky operation for which there are limited guidelines as to what the tow force and speed is for an expected trenching profile within a specified ground condition. Most ploughing schemes are designed using semi-empirical approaches, with very few computational tools able to take into account the geometric and material nonlinearity inherited by the ploughing problem. In this paper we describe how the Material Point Method (MPM) is being used as a numerical tool to model seabed ploughing with the aim of providing an improved predictive tool for the future, via an EPSRC-funded research project at Durham and Dundee Universities. Various issues are discussed in the paper including the means of modelling moving essential boundaries and the choice of basis functions, and this new method in MPM is demonstrated on a simple ploughing problem.},

The improved understanding coming from these studies must now be incorporated into improved constitutive models that can be used for analysis of foundation settlements. This paper presents a 1-D model for stepped loading using a new concept for establishing "equivalent times" during time-dependent straining. This model is then developed into a general constitutive equation for continuous loading. The model uses three parameters, X, K, and {\$}, that can be easily found using conventional oedometer tests. The general model has been used to develop analytical solutions for creep tests, relaxation tests, constant rate of strain (CRSN) tests, and tests with constant rate of stress (CRSS). Results from three different clays have been used to examine the validity of the model.},

	Abstract = {The Material Point Method (MPM) uses a combined Eulerian-Lagrangian approach to solve problems involving large deformations. A problem domain is discretised as material points which are advected on a background grid. Problems are encountered with the original MPM when material points cross between grid cells, and this has been tackled by the development of the Generalised Interpolation MPM, where material points' domains of influence extend beyond the currently occupied grid cell. In this paper, the Generalised Interpolation Material Point (GIMP) Method has been implemented implicitly in a manner that allows a global stiffness matrix to be constructed similar to that in the Finite Element Method (FEM) by combining contributions from individual elements on the background grid. An updated Lagrangian finite deformation framework has been used to ensure non-linear behaviour within each of the loadsteps. The weighting functions used for this which make the GIMP method different to standard MPM are presented and the implementation is explained. Specific details on computing the deformation gradient to be consistent with the updated Lagrangian framework and the updating of the material point influence domains are outlined, both of which are currently unclear in the published literature. It is then shown through numerical examples that for both small and large deformation elastic and elasto-plastic problems, the implicit GIMP method agrees well with analytical solutions and exhibits convergence properties between that of linear and quadratic FEM.},

In this paper, the MTF was extended for modeling wave propagation in a saturated poroelastic medium using the finite element method. Reflection coefficients of the MTF that is applied to the boundaries of a finite element grid were analytically derived for the incidence of SV, P1 and P2 waves, respectively. The effects of the excitation frequency and the artificial wave velocity on the reflection coefficients of the MTF were theoretically investigated. The MTF was then implemented into a finite element code to examine its capacity to absorb the one-dimensional longitudinal/shear wave, the plain-strain waves, the moving-load generated waves and the three-dimensional waves in the saturated poroelastic medium. It is found that the reflection coefficients evaluated from the numerical simulation agree with the predicted values in the theoretical investigations.},

	Abstract = {An extension of the Material Point Method [1] based on the Discontinuous Galerkin approximation (DG) [2] is presented here. A solid domain is represented by a collection of particles that can move and carry the fields of the problem inside an arbitrary computational grid in order to provide a Lagrangian description of the deformation without mesh tangling issues. The background mesh is then used as a support for the Discontinuous Galerkin approximation that leads to a weak form of conservation laws involving numerical fluxes defined at element faces. Those terms allow the introduction of the characteristic structure of hyperbolic problems within the numerical method by using an approximate Riemann solver [3]. The Discontinuous Galerkin Material Point Method, which can be viewed as a Discontinuous Galerkin Finite Element Method (DGFEM) with modified quadrature rule, aims at meeting advantages of both mesh-free and DG methods. The method is derived within the finite deformation framework for multidimensional problems by using a total Lagrangian formulation. A particular attention is paid to one specific discretization leading to a stability condition that allows to set the CFL number at one. The approach is illustrated and compared to existing or developed analytical solutions on one-dimensional problems and compared to the finite element method on two-dimensional simulations.},

	Abstract = {Balance of mass and linear momentum of a solid-fluid mixture furnish a complete set of equations from which the displacements of the solid matrix and the pore pressures can be resolved for the case of quasi-static loading, resulting in the so-called u - p Galerkin formulation. In this work, a recently proposed model for dense sands is utilized to model the effective stress response of the solid matrix appearing in the balance of linear momentum equation. In contrast with other more traditional models, inherent inhomogeneities in the porosity field at the meso-scale are thoroughly incorporated and coupled with the macroscopic laws of mixture theory. Also, the hydraulic conductivity is naturally treated as a function of the porosity in the solid matrix, allowing for a more realistic representation of the physical phenomenon. The aforementioned balance laws are cast into a fully nonlinear finite element program utilizing isoparametric elements satisfying the Babu{\v{s}}ka-Brezzi stability condition. Criteria for the onset of localization under locally drained and locally undrained conditions are derived and utilized to detect instabilities. Numerical simulations on dense and loose sand specimens are performed to study the effects of inhomogeneities on the stability of saturated porous media at the structural level. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {The material point method is a variant of the finite element method formulated in an arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian description of motion. Two kinds of spatial discretization are utilized in the method--the motion of material points, representing subregions of the analysed continuum, is traced against a background of the computational element mesh. The mesh can be chosen arbitrarily so that the main disadvantage of the finite element method, related to mesh distortion, is avoided. Application of the method to some large strain industrial problems as granular flow in a silo as well as geomechanical and plastic forming problems are shown. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Coombs2020,
	Abstract = {The material point method is ideally suited to modelling problems involving large deformations where conventional mesh-based methods would struggle. However, total and updated Lagrangian approaches are unsuitable and non-ideal, respectively, in terms of formulating equilibrium for the method. This is due to the basis functions, and particularly the derivatives of the basis functions, of material point methods normally being defined on an unformed, and sometimes regular, background mesh. It is possible to map the basis function spatial derivatives using the deformation at a material point but this introduces additional algorithm complexity and computational expense. This paper presents a new Lagrangian statement of equilibrium which is ideal for material point methods as it satisfies equilibrium on the undeformed background mesh at the start of a load step. The formulation is implemented using a quasi-static implicit algorithm which includes the derivation of the consistent tangent to achieve optimum convergence of the global equilibrium iterations. The method is applied to a number of large deformation elasto-plastic problems, with a specific focus of the convergence of the method towards analytical solutions with the standard, generalised interpolation and CPDI2 material point methods. For the generalised interpolation method, different domain updating methods are investigated and it is shown that all of the current methods are degenerative under certain simple deformation fields. A new domain updating approach is proposed that overcomes these issues. The proposed material point method framework can be applied to all existing material point methods and adopted for implicit and explicit analysis, however its advantages are mainly associated with the former.},

In fact, the peculiar properties of the spline shape functions typical of isogeometric methods, along with the ease of implementation and low computational cost guaranteed by the collocation framework, make the proposed approach very attractive as a viable alterna-tive to Galerkin-based approaches classically adopted in computational poromechanics.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an advanced formulation of the time-domain two-dimensional (2D) boundary element method (BEM) for an elastic, homogeneous unsaturated soil subjected to dynamic loadings. Unlike the usual time-domain BEM, the present formulation applies a con-volution quadrature which requires only the Laplace-domain instead of the time-domain fun-damental solutions. The coupled equations governing the dynamic behavior of unsaturated soils ignoring contributions of the inertia e{\textregistered}ects of the $\,^{\circ}$uids (water and air) are derived based on the poromechanics theory within the framework of a suction-based mathematical model. In this formulation, the solid skeleton displacements u i , water pressure p w and air pressure p a are presumed to be independent variables. The fundamental solutions in Laplace transformed-domain for such a dynamic u {\`{A}} p w {\`{A}} p a theory have been obtained previously by authors. Then, the BE formulation in time is derived after regularization by partial integrations and time and spatial discretizations. Thereafter, the BE formulation is implemented in a 2D boundary ele-ment code (PORO-BEM) for the numerical solution. To verify the accuracy of this imple-mentation, the displacement response obtained by the boundary element formulation is veri¯ed by comparison with the elastodynamics problem.},

	Abstract = {Based on the concept of generalized plasticity, this study proposes a constitutive model to describe the time-dependent behavior and wetting deterioration of sandstone. The proposed model (1) exhibits nonlinear elasticity under hydrostatic and shear loading, (2) follows the associated flow rule for viscoplastic deformation, (3) adopts a creep modulus that varies with the stress ratio, (4) considers the primary and secondary creep behaviors of rock, and (5) considers the effect of wetting deterioration. This model requires 13 material parameters, comprising 3 for elasticity, 7 for plasticity, and 3 for creep. All parameters can be determined easily by following the suggested procedures. The proposed model is first validated by comparison with triaxial tests of sandstone under different hydrostatic stress and cyclic loading conditions. In addition, the model is versatile in simulating time-dependent behavior through a series of multistage creep tests. Finally, to consider the effects of wetting deterioration, triaxial and creep tests under dry and water-saturated conditions are simulated. Comparison of the simulated and experimental data shows that the proposed model can predict the behavior of sandstone in dry and saturated conditions. {\textcopyright} 2013 The Author(s).},

In 1975, Wachspress proposed a general method for constructing finite element shape functions on convex polygons. Only recently has renewed interest in such interpolants surfaced in various disciplines including: geometric modeling, computer graphics, and finite element computations. This survey focuses specifically on polygonal shape functions that satisfy the properties of barycentric coordinates: (a) form a partition of unity, and are non-negative; (b) interpolate nodal data (Kronecker-delta property), (c) are linearly complete or satisfy linear precision, and (d) are smooth within the domain. We compare and contrast the construction and properties of various polygonal interpolants---Wachspress basis functions, mean value coordinates, metric coordinate method, natural neighbor-based coordinates, and maximum entropy shape functions. Numerical integration of the Galerkin weak form on polygonal domains is discussed, and the performance of these polygonal interpolants on the patch test is studied.},

	Abstract = {Abstract In this paper we present a mixed stabilized finite element formulation that does not lock and also does not exhibit unphysical oscillations near the incompressible limit. The new mixed formulation is based on a multiscale variational principle and is presented in two different forms. In the first form the displacement field is decomposed into two scales, coarse-scale and fine-scale, and the fine-scale variables are eliminated at the element level by the static condensation technique. The second form is obtained by simplifying the first form, and eliminating the fine-scale variables analytically yet retaining their effect that results with additional (stabilization) terms. We also derive, in a consistent manner, an expression for the stabilization parameter. This derivation also proves the equivalence between the classical mixed formulation with bubbles and the Galerkin least-squares type formulations for the equations of linear elasticity. We also compare the performance of this new mixed stabilized formulation with other popular finite element formulations by performing numerical simulations on three well known test problems.},

By generalizing Darcy's law applied solely to the saturated zone in an earth dam to the entire dam including the no-flow zone, a new variational inequality formulation is presented. The new formulation imposes a boundary condition of Signorini's type on the potential seepage boundary and the seepage point turns out to be such a point that makes both inequalities in Signorini's complementary condition become equalities. Singularity of the seepage point is accordingly eliminated. A strategy is developed for overcoming the mesh-dependency in the finite element implementation. {\textcopyright} 2007.},

	Abstract = {Using a simple one-dimensional shock problem as an example, the present paper investigates numerical properties of the original material point method (MPM), the generalized interpolation material point (GIMP) method, the convected particle domain interpolation (CPDI) method, and the dual domain material point (DDMP) method. For a weak isothermal shock of ideal gas, the MPM cannot be used with accuracy. With a small number of particles per cell, GIMP and CPDI produce reasonable results. However, as the number of particles increases the methods fail to converge and produce pressure spikes. The DDMP method behaves in an opposite way. With a small number of particles per cell, DDMP results are unsatisfactory. As the number of particles increases, the DDMP results converge to correct solutions, but the large number of particles needed for convergence makes the method very expensive to use in these types of shock wave problems in two- or three-dimensional cases. The cause for producing the unsatisfactory DDMP results is identified. A simple improvement to the method is introduced by using sub-points. With this improvement, the DDMP method produces high quality numerical solutions with a very small number of particles. Although in the present paper, the numerical examples are one-dimensional, all derivations are for multidimensional problems. With the technique of approximately tracking particle domains of CPDI, the extension of this sub-point method to multidimensional problems is straightforward. This new method preserves the conservation properties of the DDMP method, which conserves mass and momentum exactly and conserves energy to the second order in both spatial and temporal discretizations.},

@article{Heider2012,
	Abstract = {From a macroscopic perspective, saturated porous materials like soils represent volumetrically interacting solid--fluid aggregates. They can be properly modelled using continuum porous media theories accounting for both solid-matrix deformation and pore-fluid flow. The dynamic excitation of such multi-phase materials gives rise to different types of travelling waves, where it is of common interest to adequately describe their propagation through unbounded domains. This poses challenges for the numerical treatment and demands special solution strategies that avoid artificial and numerically-induced perturbations or interferences. The present paper is concerned with the accurate and stable numerical solution of dynamic wave propagation problems in infinite half spaces. Proceeding from an isothermal, biphasic, linear poroelasticity model with incompressible constituents, finite elements are used to discretise the near field and infinite elements to approximate the far field. The transient propagation of the poroacoustic body waves to the infinity is thereby modelled by a viscous damping boundary, which, for stability reasons, necessitates an appropriate treatment of the included velocity-dependent damping forces.

We use a low order approximation, namely, continuous piecewise-linear approximation for the displacements and fluid flux, and piecewise-constant approximation for the pressure. This results in a simple matrix structure with low bandwidth. The method is stable in both the limiting cases of small and large permeability. Moreover, the discontinuous pressure space enables efficient approximation of steep gradients such as those occurring due to rapidly changing material coefficients or boundary conditions, both of which are commonly seen in physical and biological applications.},

The material point method for the analysis of deformable bodies is revisited and originally upgraded to simulate crack propagation in brittle media. In this setting, phase-field modelling is introduced to resolve the crack path geometry. Following a particle in cell approach, the coupled continuum/phase-field governing equations are defined at a set of material points and interpolated at the nodal points of an Eulerian, ie, non-evolving, mesh. The accuracy of the simulated crack path is thus decoupled from the quality of the underlying finite element mesh and relieved from corresponding mesh-distortion errors. A staggered incremental procedure is implemented for the solution of the discrete coupled governing equations of the phase-field brittle fracture problem. The proposed method is verified through a series of benchmark tests while comparisons are made between the proposed scheme, the corresponding finite element implementation, and experimental results.},

The MPM applies a dual formulation, where the state of the problem (mass, stress, strain, velocity etc.) is tracked using a finite set of material points while the governing equations are solved on a background computational grid. Several references state, that one of the main advantages of the material-point method is the easy application of complicated material behaviour as the constitutive response is updated individually for each material point. However, as discussed here, the MPM way updating and integrating stresses in time is problematic. This is discussed using an example of the dynamical collapse of a soil column.},

Although this will introduce some new soil parameters, they do not need calibration as they can be expressed as functions of basic soil parameters through simple analytical expressions. To start with, the one-dimensional response of the model is discussed, mak- ing it possible to explore how the model is capable of capturing key features of viscous soft soil behaviour. Subsequently, the three-dimensional generalisation of the model is presented, followed by comparison with experi- mental data, showing good agreement in both triaxial undrained compression and extension.

oscillating pore pressures in the limits of low permeability, fast
loading rates, coarse meshes, and/or small time step sizes. To suppress
completely the pore pressure oscillations, a stabilized finite element
scheme with a better performance on monotonicity is proposed for
modeling compressible fluid-saturated porous media. This method, based
on the polynomial pressure projection technique, allows the use of
linear equal-order interpolation for both displacement and pore pressure
fields, which is more straightforward for both code development and
maintenance compared to others. By employing the discrete maximum
principle, a proper stabilization parameter is deduced, which is
efficient to guarantee the monotonicity and optimal in theory in the
1-dimensional case. An appealing feature of the method is that the
stabilization parameter is evaluated in terms of the properties of
porous material only, while no mesh or time step size is involved.
Through comparing the numerical simulations with the analytical
benchmarks, the efficiency of the proposed stabilization scheme is
confirmed.},

In addition, a significant amount of progress has been made in addressing the major shortcomings that were present in these methods at the early stages of their development. For instance, essential boundary conditions are almost trivial to enforce by employing the techniques now available, and the need for high order quadrature has been circumvented with the development of advanced techniques, essentially eliminating the previously existing bottleneck of computational expense in meshfree methods. Given the proper treatment, nodal integration can be made accurate and free of spatial instability, making it possible to eliminate the need for a mesh entirely. Meshfree collocation methods have also undergone significant development, which also offer a truly meshfree solution.

	Abstract = {An explicit finite element method for Biot dynamic formulation in fluid-saturated porous media is proposed. The decoupling-technique is used in the explicit finite element method. It does not need to assemble a global stiffness matrix and solve a set of linear equations in each time step, so the computational effort and memory requirement can be reduced considerably by using this method. The method is applied to analyze the dynamic response of a massless rigid foundation in a fluid-saturated porous medium. The computational results are compared with those of the elastic solution in a single-phase medium for the same problem, and it shows that if the frequency of the incident movement on rigid foundation is high (close 10 Hz), the dynamic response of the rigid foundation in fluid-saturated porous media is larger than that in single-phase media. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Pyo2013,
	Abstract = {Experiments have consistently shown that the tensile strength of concrete increases with increasing strain rate. The reasons for this phenomenon are not yet well understood and several hypotheses have been proposed in the past to explain it. This study offers additional insight through the application of dynamic fracture mechanics. The relationship between crack velocity and strain rate of concrete is first investigated using a cohesive zone model and fitted to available experimental data. The obtained relationship is then implemented into two different versions of crack-speed dependent dynamic fracture models. Both models show that computed strength versus strain rate responses compare favorably to well-established test data, suggesting that strain rate sensitivity is strongly associated with the characteristics of dynamic crack growth and inertial effects at the boundaries of the crack. A constitutive modeling scheme that incorporates the obtained dynamic fracture models into a meso-mechanical model is also proposed to predict stress-strain behavior of concrete under dynamic tensile loading. Comparisons between model predictions and published experimental data are provided to show the accuracy of the proposed framework. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, a numerical method for solving the Biot poroelastic equations is developed. These equations comprise acoustic (typically water) and elastic (porous medium frame) equations, which are coupled mainly through fluid/solid drag terms. This wave solution is coupled to a simplified form of Maxwell's equations, which is solved for the streaming potential resulting from electrokinesis. The ultimate aim is to use the generated electrical signals to provide porosity, permeability and other information about the formation surrounding a borehole. The electrical signals are generated through electrokinesis by seismic waves causing movement of the fluid through pores or fractures of a porous medium. The focus of this paper is the numerical solution of the Biot equations in displacement form, which is achieved using a mixed finite-element formulation with a different finite-element representation for displacements and stresses. The mixed formulation is used in order to reduce spurious displacement modes and fluid shear waves in the numerical solutions. These equations are solved in the time domain using an implicit unconditionally stable time-stepping method using iterative solution methods amenable to solving large systems of equations. The resulting model is embodied in the MODELLING OF ACOUSTICS, POROELASTICS AND ELECTROKINETICS (MAPEK) computer model for electroseismic analysis.},

[21], suitably extended to account for seizing contact and fracture, in applications involving terminal ballistics. The evaluation takes the form of a conventional Verification and Validation (V{\&}V) analysis. In support of the validation analysis, we have conducted tests concerned with the normal impact of Aluminum alloy 6061-T6 thin plates by S2 tool steel spherical projectile over a range of plate thicknesses of [0.8 mm, 1.6 mm] and a range of impact velocities of [100, 400]m/s. The tests were conducted at Caltech's GALCIT gas-gun Plate-Impact Facility. We find excellent agreement between measured and computed perforation areas and a ballistic limits over the thickness and velocity ranges considered. Our verification analysis consists of model-on-model comparisons and an assessment of the convergence of the OTM method. Specifically, we find excellent agreement between the incident vs. residual velocities predicted by the OTM method and by the power-law relation of Recht and Ipson [36]. We also find robust linear convergence of the OTM method as measured in terms of residual velocity error vs. number of nodes. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This paper presents a parallel computing strategy for the MPM with multiple Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) to boost the method's computational efficiency in large scale problems. Domain decomposition method is used to split the workload over subdomains onto a number of GPUs. Communication between the subdomains is implemented by the data transfer between GPUs and random access memory. On each GPU the MPM algorithm is parallelised over nodes or particles. Benchmark problems of slurry runout and surface pipe penetration are analysed to quantify the speedup of the multiple-GPU parallel simulations over the sequential counterparts on the central processing unit. The maximum speedup with 1 GPU is 84 and increases to ∼1280 using 16 GPUs.},

	Abstract = {Abstract  The singular hybrid boundary node method (SHBNM) is proposed for solving three-dimensional problems in linear elasticity. The SHBNM represents a coupling between the hybrid displacement variational formulations and moving least squares (MLS) approximation. The main idea is to reduce the dimensionality of the former and keep the meshless advantage of the later. The rigid movement method was employed to solve the hyper-singular integrations. The `boundary layer effect', which is the main drawback of the original Hybrid BNM, was overcome by an adaptive integration scheme. The source points of the fundamental solution were arranged directly on the boundary. Thus the uncertain scale factor taken in the regular hybrid boundary node method (RHBNM) can be avoided. Numerical examples for some 3D elastic problems were given to show the characteristics. The computation results obtained by the present method are in excellent agreement with the analytical solution. The parameters that influence the performance of this method were studied through the numerical examples.},

The reservoir water is modeled using both the Navier-Stokes equation based fluid element and the subsonic potential based fluid element. In the coupled analysis, hydrodynamic pressures and velocities are presented in the reservoir zone, while displacements, pore pressures and stresses are given for the earth dam and foundation domains at any earthquake time.

	Abstract = {We present an adaptive meshfree method to approximate phase-field models of biomembranes. In such models, the Helfrich curvature elastic energy, the surface area, and the enclosed volume of a vesicle are written as functionals of a continuous phase-field, which describes the interface in a smeared manner. Such functionals involve up to second-order spatial derivatives of the phase-field, leading to fourth-order Euler-Lagrange partial differential equations (PDE). The solutions develop sharp internal layers in the vicinity of the putative interface, and are nearly constant elsewhere. Thanks to the smoothness of the local maximum-entropy (max-ent) meshfree basis functions, we approximate numerically this high-order phase-field model with a direct Ritz-Galerkin method. The flexibility of the meshfree method allows us to easily adapt the grid to resolve the sharp features of the solutions. Thus, the proposed approach is more efficient than common tensor product methods (e.g. finite differences or spectral methods), and simpler than unstructured C0 finite element methods, applicable by reformulating the model as a system of second-order PDE. The proposed method, implemented here under the assumption of axisymmetry, allows us to show numerical evidence of convergence of the phase-field solutions to the sharp interface limit as the regularization parameter approaches zero. In a companion paper, we present a Lagrangian method based on the approximants analyzed here to study the dynamics of vesicles embedded in a viscous fluid. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Inc.},

	Abstract = {Hong Kong is particularly susceptible to landslide risk due to the steep natural topography and prolonged periods of high intensity rainfall. Compounding the risk of slope failure is the existence of loose fill slopes which were constructed prior to the 1970s by end-tipping. A clear understanding of the underly- ing triggering mechanisms of fast landslides in fill slopes is re- quired to analyse landslide risk and to optimise slope stabilisation strategies. The work described here had the objective of evalu- ating two candidate triggering mechanisms---static liquefaction and the transition from slide to flow due to localised transient pore water pressures---against observations of slope behaviour obtained from highly instrumented centrifuge model tests. These results indicate that static liquefaction is unlikely to occur if the model fill is unsaturated and the depth to bedrock large, as the high compressibility and mobility of air in the unsaturated void spaces allows the model fill slope to accommodate wetting col- lapse without initiating undrained failure. In contrast, high-speed failures with low-angle run-outs are shown to be easily triggered in model fill slopes from initially slow moving slips driven by localised transient pore water pressures arising from constricted seepage and material layering.},

It is demonstrated that the fidelity of information transfer from a particle representation to the computational grid is strongly dependent on particle density and location. In addition, use of non-uniform grids and even non-uniform particle sizes are shown to introduce error. An enhancement to the projection operation is developed which makes use of already available velocity gradient information. This enhancement facilitates exact projection of linear functions and reduces the dependence of projection accuracy on particle location and density for non- linear functions. The efficacy of this formulation for reducing error is demonstrated in solid mechanics simulations in one and two dimensions.},

The SPH-Code is implemented in FORTRAN 90 and parallelized with MPI. A macroscopic constitutive law with isotropic damage for fracture and fragmentation for concrete is implemented in the SPH-Code. It is shown that the SPH-method is able to simulate the fracture and fragmentation of concrete slabs under contact detonation. The numerical results from the di erent SPH-methods are compared with the data from tests. The good agreement between calculation and experiment suggests that the SPH-program can predict the correct maximum pressure as well as the damage of the concrete slabs.

The oscillations are shown to result from, at least in part, two distinctly different causes, both originating from the shape function approximations used. The first is due to the components of the stiffness matrix (or other matrices) being derived by performing numerical integration using the material points, and the second is due to calculating the strain from the nodal displacements of the elements, interpolated to the material points, via the shape function spatial derivatives. In this paper, an improvement for the recovery of results from the nodes to the material points is presented, where an increase of the Cn continuity along with an interpolation involving nodes from neighbouring elements is applied.},

	Abstract = {The newly-developed scaled boundary finite element method (SBFEM) is able to calculate stress intensity factors directly because the singularity in stress solutions at crack tips is analytically represented. By taking this advantage, a mixed-mode crack propagation model based on linear elastic fracture mechanics (LEFM) was developed in this study. A domain is first divided into a few subdomains. Because the dimensions and shapes of subdomains can be flexibly varied and only the domain boundaries or common edges between subdomains are discretised in the SBFEM, a remeshing procedure as simple as in boundary element methods was developed with minimum mesh changes whereas the generality and flexibility of the FEM is well maintained. Fully-automatic modelling of mixed-mode crack propagation is then achieved by combining the remeshing procedure with a propagation criterion. Three mixed-mode examples were modelled. Comparisons of the numerical results with those from available publications show that the developed model is capable of predicting crack trajectories and load-displacement relations accurately and efficiently. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

Contact models should robustly handle contact between geometry by preventing interpenetrations. This should be accomplished while respecting natural laws in order to maintain physical correctness.

Many methods exist that partially achieve these properties, but none yet fully attain all three. This thesis investigates existing methodologies with respect to these attributes, and proposes a novel algorithm for the simulation of deformable materials that demonstrate them all.

Within the standard material point method (MPM), the spatial errors are partially caused by the direct mapping of material-point data to the background grid. In order to reduce these errors, we introduced a novel technique that combines the least squares method with the Taylor basis functions, called the Taylor least squares (TLS), to reconstruct functions from scattered data while preserving their integrals. The TLS technique locally approximates quantities of interest such as stress and density, and when used with a suitable quadrature rule, it conserves the total mass and linear momentum after transferring the material-point information to the grid. The integration of the technique into MPM, dual domain MPM, and B-spline MPM significantly improves the results of these methods. For the considered examples, the TLS function reconstruction technique resembles the approximation properties of highly accurate spline reconstruction while preserving the physical properties of the standard algorithm.},

The multiphase material is modelled as a deforming porous continuum where heat, water and gas flow are taken into account. The independent variables are the solid displacements, the capillary and the gas pressure and the temperature. The modified effective stress state is limited by the Drucker-Prager yield surface for simplicity. Small strains and quasi-static loading conditions are assumed. Numerical results of strain localization in globally undrained samples of dense, medium dense and loose sands and isochoric geomaterial are presented. A biaxial compression test is simulated assuming plane strain condition during the computations. Vapour pressure below the saturation water pressure (cavitation) develops at localization in case of dense sands, as experimentally observed. A case of strain localization induced by a thermal load where evaporation takes place is also analysed.},

Its fully energetic formulation avoids the introduction of extra degrees of freedom to model fracture propagation. Following previous works on eigenerosion, in this publication, a modified formulation of eigenfracture it is introduced, where it is distinguished between compression and tension loaded state. This formulation has the advantage that it relates the crack propagation process only to tensile loading. The procedure is implemented using a spectral decomposition of the strain field. The application of the method to brittle fracture makes it suitable for materials like concrete. The accuracy of the method is assessed for linear elasticity in statics and dynamics for two- and three-dimensional problems.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents numerical simulations of Cone Penetration Test (CPT) in water-saturated soft soils taking into account pore pressure dissipation during installation. Besides modelling interaction between soil skeleton and pore fluid, the problem involves large soil deformations in the vicinity of the penetrometer, soil--structure interaction, and complex non-linear response of soil. This makes such simulations challenging. Depending on the soil's permeability and compressibility, undrained, partially drained or drained conditions might occur. Partially drained conditions are commonly encountered in soils such as silts and sand--clay mixtures. However, this is often neglected in CPT interpretation, which may lead to inaccurate estimates of soil properties. This paper aims at improving the understanding of the penetration process in different drainage conditions through advanced numerical analyses. A two-phase Material Point Method is applied to simulate large soil deformations and generation and dissipation of excess pore pressures during penetration. The constitutive behaviour of soil is modelled with the Modified Cam Clay model. Numerical results are compared with experimental data showing good agreement.},

These shape functions are approximated solutions of the partial differential equation (PDE) and the discretization concerns only the boundary. If the domain is split into several subdomains, one has also to discretize the interfaces. To get a true meshless integration-free method, the boundary and interface conditions are accounted by collocation procedures. It is well known that a pure collocation technique induces numerical instabilities. That is why the collocation will be coupled with the least-squares method. The numerical technique will be applied to various second order PDE's in 2D domains. Because there is no integration and the number of shape functions does not increase very much with the degree, high degree polynomials can be considered without a huge computational cost. As for instance the p-version of finite elements or some well established meshless methods, the present method permits to get very accurate solutions.},

	Abstract = {We present a mathematical framework for deformation and strain localization analyses of partially saturated granular media using three-phase continuum mixture theory. First, we develop conservation laws governing a three-phase mixture to identify energy-conjugate expressions for constitutive modeling. Energy conjugate expressions identified relate a certain measure of effective stress to the deformation of the solid matrix, the degree of saturation to the matrix suction, the pressure in each phase to the corresponding intrinsic volume change of this phase, and the seepage forces to the corresponding pressure gradients. From the second of law of thermodynamics we obtain the dissipation inequality; from the principle of maximum plastic dissipation we derive a condition for the convexity of the yield function. Then, we formulate expressions describing conditions for the onset of tabular deformation bands under locally drained and locally undrained conditions. Finally, we cast a specific constitutive model for partially saturated soils within the proposed mathematical framework, and implement it in the context of return mapping algorithm of computational plasticity. The proposed constitutive model degenerates to the classical modified Cam-Clay model of soil mechanics in the limit of full saturation. Numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the performance of the return mapping algorithm as well as illustrate the localization properties of the model as functions of imposed deformation and matrix suction histories. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {Experimental evidences have shown deficiencies of the existing overstress and creep models for viscous behaviour of natural soft clay. The purpose of this paper is to develop a modelling method for viscous behaviour of soft clays without these deficiencies. A new anisotropic elastic-viscoplastic model is extended from overstress theory of Perzyna. A scaling function based on the experimental results of constant strain-rate oedometer tests is adopted, which allows viscoplastic strain-rate occurring whether the stress state is inside or outside of the yielding surface. The inherent and induced anisotropy is modelled using the formulations of yield surface with kinematic hardening and rotation (S-CLAY1). The parameter determination is straightforward and no additional experimental test is needed, compared to the Modified Cam Clay model. Parameters determined from two types of tests (i.e., the constant strain-rate oedometer test and the 24 h standard oedometer test) are examined. Experimental verifications are carried out using the constant strain-rate and creep tests on St. Herblain clay. All comparisons between predicted and measured results demonstrate that the proposed model can successfully reproduce the anisotropic and viscous behaviours of natural soft clays under different loading conditions. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {Theory of Mixtures with Interfaces (TMI) is used to develop held equations governing the behaviour of unsaturated porous media under dynamic loading conditions. Interfaces existing between bulk phases in unsaturated porous media are explicitly considered in the TMI. Volume fractions and area densities are introduced as independent constitutive variables. A new definition for the total stress that explicitly includes interfacial effects is deduced. Thermodynamic restrictions are used to derive the constitutive relationships. It is found that there exists a well-defined potential (i.e. Gibbs' thermodynamic potential) to drive the how of the fluids. Effective stress for unsaturated soils is theoretically shown to dependent not only on the degree of saturation but also on the stress path and soil type. Theoretical basis for the use of two stress state variables, net stress and suction, instead of a single effective stress is provided. The soil-water characteristic curve is shown to be none other than the linear momentum balance equation of all the interfaces. Realistic functional forms are suggested to take into account the variation of suction when the solid skeleton undergoes deformation. The final set of governing equations presented are easily implementable into finite element methods and can be used to analyse problems such as the earthquake loading of compacted soil embankments.

	Abstract = {Due to the high nonlinearities and extreme large deformation, the hypervelocity impact simulation is a challenging task for numerical methods. Meshfree particle methods, such as the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and material point method (MPM), are promising for the simulation of hypervelocity impact problems. In this paper, the material point method is applied to the simulation of hypervelocity impact problems, and a three-dimensional MPM computer code, MPM3D, is developed. The Johnson--Cook material model and Mie--Gr{\"{u}}neisen equation of state are implemented. Furthermore, the basic formulations of MPM are compared with SPH, and their performances are compared numerically by using MPM3D and LS-DYNA SPH module. This study shows that the material point method is an efficient and promising method for simulating the hypervelocity impact problems. MPM possesses many prominent features. The formulation of MPM is simple and similar to the traditional finite element method (FEM). Spatial derivatives are calculated based on a regular computational grid in MPM, so that the time consuming neighbor searching, which is compulsory in most meshfree methods, is not required. The approximation of field variables and their spatial derivatives is efficiently evaluated using the information of only 8 grid nodes in three-dimensional problem, and the shape functions exactly satisfy the constant and linear consistency. The boundary conditions can be applied in MPM as easily as in FEM, and contact algorithm can be efficiently implemented whose cost is linear in the number of bodies. Because the same regular computational grid can be used in all time steps, the time step size keeps constant in MPM simulation.},

	Abstract = {The paper presents total-stress numerical analyses of large-displacement soil-structure interaction problems in geomechanics using the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM). This method is characterized by frequent remeshing and the use of low order finite elements to evaluate the solution. Several important features of the method are: (i) a mixed formulation (displacement-mean pressure) stabilized numerically to alleviate the volumetric locking effects that are characteristic of low order elements when the medium is incompressible, (ii) a penalty method to prescribe the contact constraints between a rigid body and a deformable media combined with an implicit scheme to solve the tangential contact constraint, (iii) an explicit algorithm with adaptive substepping and correction of the yield surface drift to integrate the finite-strain multiplicative elasto-plastic constitutive relationship, and (iv) the mapping schemes to transfer information between successive discretizations. The performance of the method is demonstrated by several numerical examples, of increasing complexity, ranging from the insertion of a rigid strip footing to a rough cone penetration test. It is shown that the proposed method requires fewer computational resources than other numerical approaches addressing the same type of problems.},

Two kinds of optimization algorithms are used to minimize the error function, the first one based on a gradient method and the second one based on a genetic algorithm. The efficiency of each algorithm related to the error function topology is discussed. Finally, it is shown that the use of a genetic algorithm to identify the soil parameters seems particularly suitable when the topology of the error function is complex.},

	Abstract = {The main objective of this work lies in the development of a variational implicit Material Point Method (MPM), implemented in the open source Kratos Multiphysics framework. The ability of the MPM technique to solve large displacement and large deformation problems is widely recognised and its use ranges over many problems in industrial and civil engineering. In the current work the continuum based implicit MPM is applied to engineering applications, where granular material flow is involved. For the resolution of the length and time scale of these particular problems, both continuum and discrete models are typically used. Even if discrete techniques predict more feasible results, nowadays, their use is limited to the investigation of element tests of particles, or to the simulation of reduced systems, not allowing to make important decisions in the analysis and design of granular processes. Some advantages of MPM over discrete methods are tested, such as, the ability to simulate granular flow at the large scale with acceptable computational cost and the capability to get information of stress and strain state in a more straightforward way. The focus of this paper is a comparative study between an irreducible and a mixed formulation, both implemented in the MPM code, to assess the improvement in accuracy and reliability of the numerical results when the latter formulation is adopted.},

Results showed that the volume fraction of chloroplast water was much larger in shade than in sun leaves, and that it averaged about one-third larger in the palisade than in the spongy parenchyma region of both leaf types. Chlorophyll fluorescence was more intense in shade than in sun leaves. In sun leaves, fluorescence was maximal in the palisade region near the junction with the spongy parenchyma, while in shade leaves, fluorescence was maximal in the upper part of the spongy layer. We concluded that 2-D NMR imaging reliably indicates the location of chloroplast water.},

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. Accurate modeling of the time-dependent behavior of geomaterials is of great importance in a number of engineering structures interacting with soft, highly compressible clay layers or with organic clays and peats. In this work, a uniaxial constitutive model, based on Perzyna's overstress theory and directly extendible to multiaxial stress conditions, is formulated and validated. The proposed constitutive approach essentially has three innovative aspects. The first concerns the implementation of two viscoplastic mechanisms within Perzyna's theory in order to distinguish between short-term (quasi-instantaneous) and long-term plastic responses. Similarly, elastic response is simulated by combining an instantaneous and a long-term viscous deformation mechanism. The second innovative aspect concerns the use of a bespoke logarithmic law for viscous effects, which has never been used before to simulate delayed soil behavior (as far as the authors are aware). The third concerns the model's extensive validation by simulating a number of different laboratory test results, including conventional and unconventional oedometer tests with small and large load increments/decrements and wide and narrow loading/unloading cycles, constant rates of stress and strain tests, and oedometer tests performed in a Rowe consolidation cell with measurement of pore pressure dissipation.},

We split the analysis into (i) initiation and (ii) propagation of the landslide, (iii) entering of the wave in the water (near field), and (iv) far field propagation. Concerning initiation, we use a coupled model in displacements and pore pressures, together with a suitable constitutive model of the generalized plasticity type describing soil behaviour. Propagation is analyzed with a depth integrated model incorporating the fluidized soil rheology. The third phase - interaction of landslide and water - is modelled with a level set algorithm which keeps track of the interfaces between solid, air and water. Propagation in the far field is performed using a depth integrated model. We will also present the results obtained with a double layer depth integrated model. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {In geomechanics one often encounters large deformations, soil-structure interaction and dynamical problems, e.g., in pile driving and installation of anchors. Moreover, geomechanical phenomena that include excessive movement of soil masses like landslides can pose a danger to human life and property. The numerical simulation of the physics is challenging, particularly if a saturated soil is subjected to dynamic loading, leading to propagation of different waves in the soil. Because of the reliance of Lagrangian finite element methods (FEM) on a mesh, they are not well suited for the treatment of extremely large deformations of solids. The need for overcoming this limitation urged researchers throughout the last decades to devote considerable effort to the development of more advanced computational techniques. Such techniques include the combination of Lagrangian and Eulerian finite element methods, meshless methods and mesh-based particle methods. The intent of this thesis is to further develop and extend the material point method (MPM), which is a mesh-based particle method, for use in geomechanics. MPM can be conceived as an extension of FEM, in which soil and structural bodies are represented by Lagrangian particles that move through an Eulerian fixed mesh. The physical properties of the continuum reside with particles throughout the computations (deformations), whereas the Eulerian mesh and its Gauss points carry no permanent information. Hence, MPM combines the best aspects of both Lagrangian and Eulerian formulations and avoids as much as possible the shortcomings of them. Three novel MPM development are described in this thesis. In the analysis of geomechanical problems that involve dynamics, absorbing boundaries are introduced to prevent the reflection ofwaves at the selected boundary of the domain. The well-known viscous boundaries, which will continuously creep under load, are modified to viscoelastic boundaries by introducing Kelvin-Voigt elements to limit such non-physical displacements. The novel extension of MPM to model the behavior of saturated soils under dynamic loading is formulated. Enhancement of volumetric strains is adopted to mitigate the spurious pressure oscillations which plague low-order finite element implementations. The algorithm is applied to predict the generation and dissipation of pore pressures in a sea dike under heavy dynamic loading by wave attack. Numerical simulation of pile driving is investigated. Results of shallow and deep penetration are presented. Due to the complex behavior of sand in pile driving, a highly non-linear advanced hypoplastic model is to be used for sand. Explicit Euler forward scheme with sub-stepping technique is used in the integration of this model. MPM is applied to analyze different geomechanical problems, including the collapse of a tunnel face, the instability of a slope and the deep installation of a dynamic anchor. The dynamic MPM can be applied to quasi-static problems. To this end, a local damping procedure for single and two-phase materials is discussed, being applied to reach fast convergence to quasi-static equilibrium. Such convergence is detected by two proposed criteria on force and energy. Mass scaling is presented as a procedure that allows the use of large time step size for problems, in which inertia effect can be disregarded.},

	Abstract = {Granular flow occurs in a broad spectrum of industrial applications that range from separation and mixing in the pharmaceutical industry, to grinding and crushing, blasting, stockpile construction, flow in and from hoppers, silos, bins, and conveyer belts, agriculture, mining and earthmoving. Two totally different approaches of modelling granular flow are the Discrete Element Method (DEM) and continuum methods such as Finite Element Methods (FEM). Continuum methods can be divided into nonpolar or classic continuum methods and polar continuum methods. Large displacements are usually present during granular flow which, without remeshing, cannot be solved with standard finite element methods due to severe mesh distortion. The Particle-in-Cell (PIC) method, which is a so-called meshless method, eliminates this problem since all the state variables are traced by material points moving through a fixed mesh. The main goal of this research was to model the flow of noncohesive granular material in front of flat bulldozer blades and into excavator buckets using a continuum method. A PIC code was developed to model these processes under plane strain conditions. A contact model was used to model Coulomb friction between the material and the bucket/blade. Analytical solutions, published numerical and experimental results were used to validate the contact model and to demonstrate the code's ability to model large displacements and deformations. The ability of both DEM and PIC to predict the forces acting on the blade and bucket and the material flow patterns were demonstrated. Shear bands that develop during the flow of material were investigated. As part of the PIC analyses, a comparison between classic continuum and polar continuum (Cosserat) results were made. This includes mesh size and orientation dependency, flow patterns and the forces acting on the blade and the bucket. It is concluded that the interaction of buckets and blades with granular materials can successfully be modelled with PIC. In the cases conducted here, the nonpolar continuum was more accurate than the polar continuum, but the polar continuum results were less dependent on the mesh size. The next step would be to apply this technology to solve industrial problems.},

	Abstract = {Numerical convergence properties of a recently developed Jacobian-free Newton-Krylov (JFNK) solver are compared to the ones of the widely used EVP model when solving the sea ice momentum equation with a Viscous-Plastic (VP) formulation. To do so, very accurate reference solutions are produced with an independent Picard solver with an advective time step of 10. s and a tight nonlinear convergence criterion on 10, 20, 40, and 80-km grids. Approximate solutions with the JFNK and EVP solvers are obtained for advective time steps of 10, 20 and 30. min. Because of an artificial elastic term, the EVP model permits an explicit time-stepping scheme with a relatively large subcycling time step. The elastic waves excited during the subcycling are intended to damp out and almost entirely disappear such that the approximate solution should be close to the VP solution. Results show that residual elastic waves cause the EVP approximate solution to have notable differences with the reference solution and that these differences get more important as the grid is refined. Compared to the reference solution, additional shear lines and zones of strong convergence/divergence are seen in the EVP approximate solution. The approximate solution obtained with the JFNK solver is very close to the reference solution for all spatial resolutions tested. {\textcopyright} 2012.},

The closed-form transient fundamental solutions both for the limiting case (early time approximation) and for the general case are derived from corresponding ones in the Laplace transform domain by means of Laplace transform techniques. They represent the very first satisfactory fundamental solutions in the real-time domain for full dynamic poroelasticity. Some characteristics of the solutions are investigated. Selected numerical results are presented to demonstrate the features of the waves, and the accuracy of the solution is established by comparing them with Laplace transform domain solutions.

	Abstract = {In this paper, we propose an algorithm that optimizes the ventricular fiber structure of the human heart. A number of histological studies and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging analyses have revealed that the myocardial fiber forms a right-handed helix at the endocardium. However, the fiber formation changes its orientation as a function of transmural depth, becoming a left-handed helix at the epicardium. To determine how nature can construct such a structure, which obtains surprising pumping performance, we introduce macroscopic modeling of the branching structure of cardiac myocytes in our finite element ventricular model and utilize this in an optimization process. We put a set of multidirectional fibers around a central fiber orientation at each point of the ventricle walls and simulate heartbeats by generating contraction forces along each of these directions. We examine two optimization processes using the workloads or impulses measured in these directions to update the central fiber orientation. Both processes improve the pumping performance towards an optimal value within several tens of heartbeats, starting from an almost-flat fiber orientation. However, compared with the workload optimization, the impulse optimization produces better agreement with experimental studies on transmural changes of fiber helix angle, streamline patterns of characteristic helical structures, and temporal changes in strain. Furthermore, the impulse optimization is robust under geometrical changes of the heart and tends to homogenize various mechanical factors such as the stretch and stretch rate along the fiber orientation, the contraction force, and energy consumption.},

@article{Chen2015,
	Abstract = {For extreme deformation problems, material point method (MPM) takes competitive advantages compared with finite element method (FEM) which often encounters mesh distortion. However, for small deformation problems, FEM is still more efficient and accurate than MPM in most cases. Hence, a coupled finite element material point (CFEMP) method and an adaptive finite element material point method (AFEMP) have been proposed by our group to take advantages of both methods. Because the coupling between MPM particles and FEM elements was implemented based on the MPM grid-based contact method, both CFEMP and AFEMP demand a high degree of consistence of meshing between FEM domain and MPM domain. This may lead to over meshing in FEM domain, thus significantly decreases the time step size and increases computational cost as well as data storage. In order to allow arbitrary inconsistent meshing, the CFEMP and AFEMP methods are further improved in this article. The coupling between the MPM particles and FEM elements is implemented based on a particle-to-surface contact algorithm rather than the MPM grid-based contact method, so that the consistent meshing is no more needed. Thus, the meshing of FEM body can be much coarser than the MPM grid. Numerical studies illustrate that the robustness, efficiency and accuracy of the improved CFEMP (ICFEMP) method and the improved AFEMP (IAFEMP) method are much higher than MPM, CFEMP and AFEMP.},

The constitutive model is formulated based on the nonstationary flow surface theory and incorporates new developments, including (i) an improved definition of the nonstationary flow surface that is capable of capturing the stress-strain behaviors under different loading paths, (ii) a unique stress-strain-viscoplastic-strain-rate equation that is able to explicitly describe the nonstationary flow surface, and (iii) a final stable state concept that identifies the final equilibrium state at the end of creep and stress relaxation, which is also used to simplify the loading criteria. The consistency condition is validated for the proposed model, and the viscoplastic multipliers are calculated by solving the consistency equations. The model performance is investigated and validated via simulation of both oedometer and triaxial tests. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed model is able to reproduce the main viscoplastic behaviors of soils, including creep, undrained creep rupture, stress relaxation, rate effect and accumulated effect.},

@article{Sofianos2019,
	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 OWZ The material point method (MPM) is an advancement of particle in cell method, in which Lagrangian bodies are discretized by a number of material points that hold all the properties and the state of the material. All internal variables, stress, strain, velocity, etc., which specify the current state, and are required to advance the solution, are stored in the material points. A background grid is employed to solve the governing equations by interpolating the material point data to the grid. The derived momentum conservation equations are solved at the grid nodes and information is transferred back to the material points and the background grid is reset, ready to handle the next iteration. In this work, the standard explicit MPM is extended to account for smooth elastoplastic material behavior with mixed isotropic and kinematic hardening and stiffness and strength degradation. The strains are decomposed into an elastic and an inelastic part according to the strain decomposition rule. To account for the different phases during elastic loading or unloading and smoothening the transition from the elastic to inelastic regime, two Heaviside-type functions are introduced. These act as switches and incorporate the yield function and the hardening laws to control the whole cyclic behavior. A single expression is thus established for the plastic multiplier for the whole range of stresses. This overpasses the need for a piecewise approach and a demanding bookkeeping mechanism especially when multilinear models are concerned that account for stiffness and strength degradation. The final form of the constitutive stress rate--strain rate relation incorporates the tangent modulus of elasticity, which now includes the Heaviside functions and gathers all the governing behavior, facilitating considerably the simulation of nonlinear response in the MPM framework. Numerical results are presented that validate the proposed formulation in the context of the MPM in comparison with finite element method and experimental results.},

@article{Cattoni2019,
	Abstract = {In recent years, much attention has been paid to performance--based design of flexible retaining structures, focusing on the evaluation of the permanent deformations of the soil--structure system caused by given seismic loads, rather than on the assessment of conventional safety factors determined by comparing seismic actions and system resistance (typically based on limit equilibrium methods). While only a few examples of fully coupled, dynamic numerical simulations of flexible retaining structures adopting advanced cyclic/dynamic models for soils can be found in literature, a number of recent works have proposed simple modifications of the classical Newmark method to assess the permanent displacements of the structure at the end of the seismic excitation. Most of the aforementioned works refer to cantilevered diaphragm walls, for which the failure mechanisms at limit equilibrium are relatively simple to describe. However, this is not the case for anchored or propped flexible structures, where the velocity field at failure under a pseudo--static seismic load is quite complex and can be affected by the plastic yielding of the wall upon bending. In this work, upper-- and lower--bound limit analysis FE solutions are used as a basis for the development of a Generalized Newmark Method, based on the accurate evaluation of the critical accelerations for the retaining structure and the corresponding failure mechanisms. It can be shown that, under two reasonable simplifying assumptions, a Newmark--like scalar dynamic equation of motion can be derived which, upon double integration in time, provides the magnitude of the permanent displacements associated to each failure mechanism, as provided by limit analysis. This procedure allows the reconstruction of the full permanent displacement field around the excavation, not just the evaluation of horizontal soil movements at selected points. The application of the method to a number of selected prototype excavations demonstrates the potentiality of the proposed approach, which can be extended easily to other complex geotechnical structures.},

	Abstract = {We present an implicit-explicit multi-time-step method for structural dynamics using the family of Generalized-$\alpha$ methods. With the proposed partitioned method, one can divide a complex structural domain into several subdomains and solve the individual subdomains sep-arately. The solution of the original global problem is retrieved by enforcing the prescribed velocity continuity at subdomain interfaces like the method of Gravouil and Combescure (GC method). For large-scale simulations, e.g., to solve a global-local Finite Element model with a coarse global model of the whole structure and several refined local models of parts of the structure, the proposed scheme can be effective. In order to implement the Generalized-$\alpha$ method to the multi-time-step integration, first we derive a new predictor-corrector form of the implicit Generalized-$\alpha$ method from the implicit method previously introduced by Arnold and Br{\"{u}}ls. Secondly, we propose a new predictor-corrector form of the explicit Generalized-$\alpha$ method. Both the implicit method and the explicit method are the one-step four-stage vari-ants of the Generalized-$\alpha$ methods. Finally, we built our partitioned scheme with the extended Generalized-$\alpha$ methods. The multi-time-step method is obtained based on the Prakash and Hjelmstad's method (PH method). We study the convergence of the current multi-time-step method by examining a single degree of freedom model problem. It is found that the current multi-time-step method maintains second-order accuracy, both with a unique time scale and with different time scales in each subdomain. Moreover, the current multi-time-step method is not dissipative at subdomain interfaces. Its numerical dissipation is solely introduced by the Generalized-$\alpha$ methods in each subdomain.},

	Abstract = {In this work, smoothed meshfree methods are firstly applied to numerically analyze nonlinear pore-dynamic models. A weakened weak formulation based on the edges of triangular cells obtained by a Delaunay triangulation is considered here, framing the so-called edge-based smoothed domains. The meshfree shape functions are computed by the radial point interpolation method considering the T6-scheme for the shape function support domains. Enhanced procedures to compute the mass, compressibility and coupling matrices of the pore-dynamic model are discussed, which are consistent with the computation of the stiffness and permeability matrices (as well as internal force vectors, in case of nonlinear analyses) of the edge-based smoothed domain formulation and that consider finer local integration techniques at lower computational costs, rendering more accurate and efficient procedures. Two numerical formulations are considered here to analyze the time-domain nonlinear coupled system of equations that arises once the spatial discretization is accomplished: the standard Newmark/Newton-Raphson method and an alternative iterative coupling approach. In this iterative approach, each phase of the coupled problem is treated separately, uncoupling the governing equations of the model; thus, smaller and better conditioned systems of equations are obtained, rendering more attractive techniques. A relaxation parameter is introduced in order to improve the efficiency of the iterative coupling procedure and an expression to compute optimal values for the relaxation parameter is discussed. At the end of the paper, numerical examples are presented, illustrating the effectiveness and potentialities of the proposed methodologies. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V.},

	Abstract = {We propose a particle-based technique for simulating incompressible fluid that integrates adaptive refinement of particle sampling. Each particle represents a mass of fluid in its local region. Particles can be split into several par-ticles in highly deformable areas for a detailed represen-tation. Similarly, in regions of smooth flow, nearby parti-cles can be merged into a single particle. Depth below the surface and Reynolds number are exploited as our criteria for determining whether splitting or merging should take place. For the fluid dynamics calculations, we use the hy-brid FLIP method, which is computationally simple and ef-ficient. Each particle has a volume and an effective range, based on its volume. A kernel function is used for trans-ferring and updating the particle's physical properties such as mass and velocity. Our adaptive particle-based simu-lation is demonstrated in several scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing fine detail of the flow, where needed, while efficiently sampling regions where less detail is required.},

A soil--pore fluid coupled MPM algorithm based on Biot's mixture theory is proposed for solving hydromechanical interaction problems that include changes in water table location with time. The accuracy of the proposed method is examined by comparing the results of the simulation of a one-dimensional consolidation test with the corresponding analytical solution. A sensitivity analysis of the MPM parameters used in the proposed method is carried out for examining the effect of the number of particles per mesh and mesh size on solution accuracy. For demonstrating the capability of the proposed method, a physical model experiment of a large-scale levee failure by seepage is simulated.

	Abstract = {Explicit dynamic codes which are used currently for the study of plastic deformations in impact, or with some modification for metal forming, suffer two serious limitations.First, only quadrilateral or hexahedral linear elements can be used thus limiting the possibilities of adaptive refinement and adaptive meshing.Second, even with the use of such elements, special devices such as reduced integration must be introduced to avoid locking and reduce costs. These necessitate complex hour glass control, mending-type procedures.The main difficulties are those due to the need of treatment of (almost) incompressible deformation modes. Recently, similar difficulties have been overcome in the context of fluid dynamics soil dynamics and we show here how the processes introduced there can be adopted effectively to the present problem, thus allowing an almost unrestricted choice of element interpolations. {\textcopyright} 1998 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Gorke2012,
	Abstract = {This paper presents the theoretical background of a phenomenological biphasic model at large strains based on a generalized material description of the theory of porous media, and its numerical realization within the context of a mixed finite element formulation. The study is aimed at the simulation of coupled hydro-mechanical (HM) problems with special focus on geo- and biomechanics. If, in the sense of an initial approximation, the materials of interest can be considered as a mixture of two immiscible components (solid and fluid phases), they can be modeled as saturated porous media. For the numerical treatment of according problems within a finite element approach, the weak formulation of the balance equations of mass and linear momentum of the overall continuum are developed. Within this context, a generalized material approach is preferred assuming the initial configuration of the solid phase as reference configuration of the overall continuum. The transient problem results in a weak formulation with respect to the displacement and pore pressure fields as well as their time derivatives. Following, time discretization is performed using a generalized single step approach, and a linearization technique based on Taylor series representation is applied. After the usual spatial discretization, a global system for the incremental solution of the initial-boundary value problem within the framework of a stable mixed u/p-c finite element approach is defined. This algorithmic proceeding comprises some different conceptual aspects compared to the known literature, and is characterized by a consistent and comprehensive representation. The presented numerical model was implemented into a scientific in-house finite element code based on hierarchical structures, which support the straightforward use of an iterative solver with hierarchical preconditioning, local adaptive remeshing techniques, and parallelized programming features. The accuracy and the efficiency of the numerical algorithms are demonstrated on typical examples. Therewith, the importance of the consideration of large strains in a consistent and proper way is demonstrated as well as the differences compared to models based on small strains. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS.

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 - Yugoslav Journal of Operations Research. Reformulation local search (RLS) has been recently proposed as a new approach for solving continuous location problems. The main idea, although not new, is to exploit the relation between the continuous model and its discrete counterpart. The RLS switches between the continuous model and a discrete relaxation in order to expand the search. In each iteration new points obtained in the continuous pha.se are added to the discrete formulation. Thus, the two formulations become equivalent in a limiting sense. In this paper we introduce the idea of adding 'injection points' in the discrete pha.se of RLS in order to escape a current local solution. Preliminary results are obtained on benchmark data sets for the multi-source Weber problem that support further investigation of the RLS framework.},

@article{Huang2020,
	Abstract = {Data-driven material models have many advantages over classical numerical approaches, such as the direct utilization of experimental data and the possibility to improve performance of predictions when additional data is available. One approach to develop a data-driven material model is to use machine learning tools. These can be trained offline to fit an observed material behaviour and then be applied in online applications. However, learning and predicting history dependent material models, such as plasticity, is still challenging. In this work, a machine learning based material modelling framework is proposed for both elasticity and plasticity. The machine learning based hyperelasticity model is developed with the Feed forward Neural Network (FNN) directly whereas the machine learning based plasticity model is developed by using of a novel method called Proper Orthogonal Decomposition Feed forward Neural Network (PODFNN). In order to account for the loading history, the accumulated absolute strain is proposed to be the history variable of the plasticity model. Additionally, the strain-stress sequence data for plasticity is collected from different loading-unloading paths based on the concept of sequence for plasticity. By means of the POD, the multi-dimensional stress sequence is decoupled leading to independent one dimensional coefficient sequences. In this case, the neural network with multiple output is replaced by multiple independent neural networks each possessing a one-dimensional output, which leads to less training time and better training performance. To apply the machine learning based material model in finite element analysis, the tangent matrix is derived by the automatic symbolic differentiation tool AceGen. The effectiveness and generalization of the presented models are investigated by a series of numerical examples using both 2D and 3D finite element analysis.},

@article{Bing2019,
	Abstract = {The material point method is an increasingly popular method for tackling solid mechanics problems involving large deformations. However, there are issues associated with applying boundary conditions in the method and, to date, no general approach for imposing both Neumann and Dirichlet boundary conditions has been proposed. In this paper, a new B-spline based boundary method is developed as a complete methodology for boundary representation, boundary tracking and boundary condition imposition in the standard material point method. The B-spline interpolation technique is employed to form continuous boundaries which are independent of the background mesh. Dirichlet boundary conditions are enforced by combining the B-spline boundaries with an implicit boundary method. Neumann boundary conditions are included by direct integration of surface tractions along the B-spline boundary. This general boundary method not only widens the problems that can be analysed by all variants of the material point method, when implemented using an implicit solver, but is also applicable to other embedded and non-matching mesh approaches. Although the Dirichlet boundary conditions are restricted to implicit methods, boundary representation, tracking and Neumann boundary condition enforcement can be applied to explicit and implicit methods.},

	Abstract = {Numerical modeling of reservoirs with low permeability or under undrained conditions often suffers from spurious fluid pressure oscillations due to the improper construction of approximation spaces. To address this issue, a fully coupled, stabilized meshfree formulation is developed based on a fluid pressure projection method, in which an additional stabilization term is added to the variational equation to correct the deficiency of the equal-order u--p reproducing kernel approximation. The projection scheme is formulated under the framework of the stabilized conforming nodal integration which enables a significant enhancement of the computational efficiency and accuracy, and the spurious low-energy modes of nodal integration are also eliminated. The effectiveness of the proposed stabilized meshfree formulation is demonstrated by solving several benchmark problems.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a new framework for elastic viscoplastic (EVP) constitutive modelling. In developing the model, a general one-dimensional elastic viscoplastic (1D EVP) relationship is first derived for isotropic stressing conditions using an "equivalent-time" concept. This 1D EVP model is then generalized into a three-dimensional EVP model based on Modified Cam-Clay and viscoplasticity. Fitting functions are proposed for fitting data when model parameters are being determined. Using these functions, a specific EVP model is developed which describes the time-dependent stress-strain behaviour of soils under triaxial stress states. This model has been calibrated using data from a densely compacted sand-bentonite mixture. The calibrated model is used to compute time-dependent (or strain rate dependent) stress-strain curves from a multistage shear creep test and a step-changed, constant strain rate undrained triaxial compression test. Predictions from the EVP model are in general agreement with measured values. It is demonstrated that the model can simulate accelerating creep when deviator stresses are close to the shear strength envelope in a q creep test. It can also model the behaviour in unloading-reloading and relaxation. Limitations and possible improvements are also indicated.},

	Abstract = {Stress inaccuracies (oscillations) are one of the main problems in the material point method (MPM), especially when advanced constitutive models are used. The origins of such oscillations are a combination of poor force and stiffness integration, stress recovery inaccuracies, and cell crossing problems. These are caused mainly by the use of shape function gradients and the use of material points for integration in MPM.The most common techniques developed to reduce stress oscillations consider adapting the shape function gradients so that they are continuous at the nodes. These techniques improve MPM, but problems remain, particularly in two and three dimensional cases. In this paper, the stress inaccuracies are investigated in detail, with particular reference to an implicit time integration scheme. Three modifications to MPM are implemented, and together these are able to remove almost all of the observed oscillations.},

	Abstract = {Wave propagation in porous media is an important topic for example in geomechanics or oil-industry. Especially due to the interplay of the solid skeleton with the fluid the so-called second compressional wave appears. The existence of this wave is reported in the literature not only for Biot's theory (BT) but also for theoretical approaches based on the Theory of Porous Media (TPM - mixture theory extended by the concept of volume fractions). Assuming a geometrically linear description (small displacements and small deformation gradients) and linear constitutive equations (Hooke's law) the governing equations are derived for both theories, BT and the TPM, respectively. In both cases, the solid displacements and the pore pressure are the primary unknowns. Note that this is only possible in the Laplace domain leading to the same structure of the coupled differential equations for both approaches. But the differential equations arising in BT and TPM possess different coefficients with different physical interpretations. Correlating these coefficients to each other leads to the well-known problem of Biot's "apparent mass density". Furthermore, some inconsistencies are observed if Biot's stress coefficient is correlated to the structure arising in TPM. In addition to the comparison of the governing equations and the identification of the model parameters, the displacement and pressure solutions of both theories are presented for a one-dimensional column. The results show good agreement between both approaches in case of incompressible constituents whereas in case of compressible constituents large differences appear.},

A recently developed eigensoftening algorithm to deal with the fracture of quasi-brittle materials is employed in a meshfree framework. Three point bending tests on notched beams reinforced with steel fibers carried out through a drop weight device at two loading velocities are modelled. Since the notch was placed with an offset from the middle section, mixed-mode crack formation was facilitated. Assuming a linear softening stress-equivalent crack opening relation, the numerical methodology is first validated against experimental results on plain concrete. Subsequently, it is applied to study the dynamic fracture of fiber reinforced concrete with a newly-proposed bilinear relation. The studies reveal that the total fracture energy dissipation plays an important role on the peak reaction load, whereas the transitional point between the two branches has a significant influence on the crack patterns. Parametric studies on the notch position are also carried out. The results show that the notch position has a significant influence on the crack patterns.},

	Abstract = {A cohesive formulation of fracture is taken as a basis for the simulation of processes of combined tension-shear damage and mixed-mode fracture in specimens subjected to dynamic loading. Our three-dimensional finite-element calculations account explicitly for crack nucleation, microcracking, the development of macroscopic cracks and inertia. In particular, a tension-shear damage coupling arises as a direct consequence of slanted microcrack formation in the process zone. We validate the model against the three-point-bend concrete beam experiments of Guo et al. (International Journal of Solids and Structures 1995; 32(17/18):2951-2607), John (PhD Thesis, Northwestern University, 1988), and John and Shah (Journal of Structural Engineering 1990; 116(3):585-602) in which a pre-crack is shifted from the central cross-section, leading to asymmetric loading conditions and the development of a mixed-mode process zone. The model accurately captures the experimentally observed fracture patterns and displacement fields, as well as crack paths and crack-tip velocities, as a function of precrack geometry and loading conditions. In particular, it correctly accounts for the competition between crack-growth and nucleation mechanisms. Copyright (C) 2001 John Wiley {\&} Sons, Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Numerical analysis of fracture in concrete is studied with a simplified meshless method. In this meshless method, the crack is represented by a set of disconnected cohesive crack segments that are required to pass through meshless nodes. The crack method therefore falls in the category of discrete crack methods. However, in contrast to most other methods where the crack is represented as continuous line/surface, no representation of the crack surface is needed. Hence, there is no need to track the crack path. Branching cracks and coalescing cracks are a natural outcome of the analysis and no specific algorithms need to be incorporated to model such complicated events. Besides the simplicity of the method, the accuracy is maintained. This is demonstrated through several examples. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {A new predictor-corrector explicit time integration algorithm is presented for solving structural dynamics problems. The basis of the algorithm is the implicit generalized-$\alpha$ method developed by the authors. Like its implicit parent, the explicit generalized-$\alpha$ method is a one-parameter family of algorithms in which the parameter defines the high-frequency numerical dissipation. For a given value of high-frequency dissipation, the explicit generalized-$\alpha$ method minimizes low-frequency dissipation. The algorithm can be utilized effectively for structural dynamics calculations in which numerical dissipation is needed to reduce spurious oscillations. Parameter values are given that enable physical damping to be treated explicitly while maintaining second-order accuracy without the need for an expensive second corrector pass.},

	Abstract = {In this paper two different numerical approaches for consolidation in porous media are developed and thoroughly compared: Galerkin finite element method (GFEM) and least-squares mixed finite element methods (LS-MFEM). The primary variables of the GFEM are fluid pressure and solid displacement. Fluid fluxes and stresses are derived quantities. In the LS-MFEM method all four unknown functions are primary variables, which results in more accurate approximations of fluid fluxes and stresses. Results of both numerical methods are compared for two examples. The first example, for which an analytical solution is known, is used in order to verify the implementation of the numerical schemes. In the second example, for a footing problem which was proposed by Murad et al. [M. Murad, V. Thom{\'{e}}e, A.

	Abstract = {The tensile instability in smoothed particle hydrodynamics results in a clustering of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) particles. The clustering is particularly noticeable in materials which have an equation of state which can give rise to negative pressures, but it can occur in gases where the pressure is always positive and in magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) problems. It is a particular problem in solid body computations where the instability may corrupt physical fragmentation by numerical fragmentation which, in some cases, is so severe that the dynamics of the system is completely wrong. In this paper it is shown how the instability can be removed by using an artificial stress which, in the case of fluids, is an artificial pressure. The method is analyzed by examining the dispersion relation for small oscillations in a fluid with a stiff equation of state. The short and long wavelength limits of the dispersion relation indicate appropriate parameters for the artificial pressure and, with these parameters, the errors in the long wavelength limit are small. Numerical studies of the dispersion relation for a wide range of parameters confirm the approximate analytical results for the dispersion relation. Applications to several test problems show that the artificial stress works effectively. These problems include the evolution of a region with negative pressure, extreme expansion in one dimension, and the collision of rubber cylinders. To study this latter problem the artificial pressure is generalized to an artificial stress. The results agree well with the calculations of other stable codes. {\textcopyright} 2000 Academic Press.},

From the governing equations of saturated poroelastic soil in a cylindrical coordinate system, the eighth-order state-space equation of consolidation is obtained by eliminating the variation of time t using the Laplace transform together with the technique of Fourier expansions with respect to the coordinate theta and the Hankel transform with respect to coordinate r. The solution of the eighth-order state-space equation is derived directly by using the Laplace transform and its inversion of the z-domain. Based on the continuity between layers and the boundary conditions, the transfer-matrix method is utilized to derive the solutions for the consolidation of a multi-layered soil under circular loading in the transformed domain. By the inversion of the Laplace transform and the Hankel transform, the analytical solutions in the physical domain are obtained. A numerical analysis based on the solutions is carried out by a corresponding program.},

The proposed MPM code is validated by a sand collapse experiment. The simulation result is in good agreement with the experiment result. We used the MPM with the strain softening model to simulate the entire failure of the rotational slide. Numerical results of the location of rupture surface, energy, and run-out distance are related to the parameters of the strain softening model, such as the value of the peak strength parameters and the residual strength parameters. In addition, the randomness of the landslide strength parameter is also one of the important factors that affect the landslide deformation and evolution of the rupture surface. The smaller value of the strength parameter in random MPM makes the landslide unstable.},

@article{Islam2014,
	Abstract = {Soft clays are associated with low shear strength, low permeability and high water content and they are mostly highly compressible. When a geotechnical structure for example road embankment is founded on such soft soil, it exhibits time-dependent deformations due to external loading. The excessive deformation in soft clay deposit may lead to damage of the structure or result in high maintenance cost. Nevertheless, due to increase of population and urbanization it is sometimes difficult to avoid construction of infrastructure on such clay deposit. Therefore, any structure founded on problematic soft clay requires accurate prediction of deformation with time, which includes prediction of time-dependent deformational behaviour of clay, to mitigate post construction damage. Predicting the time-dependent viscous behaviour of soft clay is a geotechnical challenge due to heterogeneity and complex formation of soils. To cope with this challenge, different elastic-viscoplastic (EVP) models are developed in this thesis adopting associated flow rule and non-associated flow rule in general stress space considering time dependent viscous behaviour of soft clay. These models are implemented in fully coupled consolidated non-linear finite element code AFENA involving composite bounding surface as well as Modified Cam Clay (MCC) equivalent single surface. Seven parameters are used in models that involve composite surface while six parameters for the single surface model, which are defined according to soil mechanics principles. Parameters of EVP models can be extracted from conventional oedometer and triaxial tests. Performances of the models in capturing the behaviours of natural clays: (Osaka clay, Shanghai clay) and reconstituted clays: (Kaolin clay, Hong Kong Marine Deposit clay, and Fukakusa clay), under drained and undrained conditions; different initial states (void ratio, mean pressure, over-consolidation ratio) and loading conditions (stress or strain controlled, strain rate) are also presented in this thesis. To account for softening behaviour of natural soft clay, a modification is also introduced for the EVP models developed in this thesis. i The time-dependent viscous behaviour of soft clay is incorporated in these models adopting creep co-efficient. Implementation of constant creep in EVP model is common, whereas from long term laboratory tests it is revealed that linear or constant approximation of creep co-efficient may lead to misleading prediction. However, existing non-linear creep functions are either limited to specific EVP models or anchored in the clay for which it is derived. To avoid the complexity associated with non-linear creep function for EVP models, a general non-linear function is presented which is neither tied to any specific model nor any specific soil group. Moreover, this creep function does not involve any fitting parameters as it is evident in some non-linear creep functions proposed in the literature. To verify the predictability of the EVP models developed in this thesis for long-term performances, an instrumented Nerang Broadbeach Road (NBR) embankment's field monitored data are compared with predictions obtained using the EVP models as well as that using the MCC model. The NBR embankment's complete subsoil details are presented in this thesis and the model parameters are extracted from laboratory tests like oedometer tests, triaxial tests and field tests such as vane shear tests, cone penetration tests (CPT) and piezocone dissipation tests (CPT-u). The interpreted model parameters obtained from CPT and CPT-u tests are also compared with laboratory obtained data. Another important aspect of this thesis is that a simplified observational approach is proposed based on field monitored data which is capable to capture the time-dependent viscous response. The method is employed to predict the ultimate settlement as well as time-settlement relation for NBR embankment. The proposed observational approach prediction capabilities are compared with Asaoka and Hyperbola methods and coupled consolidated finite element analyses adopting MCC model as well as associated and non-associated flow rule based EVP models},

The DSC model, however, can allow for non-associative behavior through the use of disturbance. Both models are able to simulate load-deformation including softening behavior. However, the GPM is based on the continuum approach while the DSC can allow for discontinuity due to factors such as microcracking. Predictions by both models show good agreement with laboratory data. A comparison between the DSC/HISS and generalized plasticity model is presented and it is found that the DSC/HISS model has certain advantages over the generalized plasticity model. A modified Terzaghi theory is developed for the bearing capacity based on the dependence of material behavior and in-situ stress; it can be used to compute the bearing capacity affected by in-situ stress.},

In this paper we present some numerical results on brittle fracture obtained by using cohesive theories of fracture. In the numerical calculations, the branching instability is a natural outcome of the explicit formulation. The cohesive model captures the basic features of experiments, such as the transition of the crack surface from smooth to hackled with increasing energy flux, and the power-law functional form of the profile of the crack branches. {\textcopyright} 2007 Springer.},

	Abstract = {We describe an adaptive particle-based technique for simulating incompressible fluid that uses an octree structure to compute inter-particle interactions and to compute the pressure field. Our method extends the hybrid Flip technique by supporting adaptive splitting and merging of fluid particles, and adaptive spatial sampling for the reconstruction of the velocity and pressure fields. Particle splitting allows a detailed sampling of fluid momentum in regions of complex flow. Particle merging, in regions of smooth flow, reduces memory and computational overhead. The octree supporting field-based calculations is adapted to provide a fine spatial reconstruction where particles are small and a coarse reconstruction where particles are large. This scheme places computational resources where they are most needed, to handle both flow and surface complexity. Thus, incompressibility can be enforced even in very small, but highly turbulent areas. Simultaneously, the level of detail is very high in these areas, allowing the direct support of tiny splashes and small-scale surface tension effects. This produces a finely detailed and realistic representation of surface motion.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we establish a link between maximizing (information-theoretic) entropy and the construction of polygonal interpolants. The determination of shape functions on n-gons (n{\textgreater}3) leads to a non-unique under-determined system of linear equations. The barycentric co-ordinates ϕi, which form a partition of unity, are associated with discrete probability measures, and the linear reproducing conditions are the counterpart of the expectations of a linear function. The ϕi are computed by maximizing the uncertainty H(ϕ1,ϕ2,{\ldots},ϕn)=−∑ ni=1 ϕi logϕi, subject to the above constraints. The description is expository in nature, and the numerical results via the maximum entropy (MAXENT) formulation are compared to those obtained from a few distinct polygonal interpolants. The maximum entropy formulation leads to a feasible solution for ϕi in any convex or non-convex polygon. This study is an instance of the application of the maximum entropy principle, wherein least-biased inference is made on the basis of incomplete information.

	Abstract = {The classical material point method (MPM) developed in the 90s is known for drawbacks which affect the quality of results. The movement of material points from one element to another leads to non-physical oscillations known as `grid crossing errors'. Furthermore, the use of material points as integration points renders a numerical quadrature rule of limited quality. Different solutions have been proposed in recent years to overcome these drawbacks. In this paper the approach of combining quadratic B-spline basis functions with a reconstruction based quadrature rule is pursued to solve these numerical problems. High-order B-spline basis functions solve the problem of grid crossing completely, whereas the considered reconstruction based quadrature rule reduces the quadrature error observed with MPM. In addition, the use of quadratic B-splines leads to a more accurate piecewise linear approximation of the stress field compared to the piecewise constant one obtained with linear Lagrangian basis functions commonly used with MPM. Two 1D benchmarks are considered involving large deformations, a vibrating bar and a column under self-weight. They render excellent results when adopting this high-order MPM.},

As a result, the complexity and the bandwidth of the global matrix are significantly reduced and hence the efficiency is improved. The other advantage of the scheme is the fulfilment of the inf-sup stability condition. The scheme is developed to solve porous media formulations derived from the theory of porous media.

The advantages of the resulting model, with respect to other formulations, is its solid consistency with geomechanical general theories, its full three-dimensional formulation, and its capability of simulating time-dependent phenomena increasingly observed in practice.

Due to the specific singular choice of weight functions, which is needed to guarantee the interpolation, there arises a problem of finding the inverse of the occurring singular matrix. The inverse is carried out using a regularization of weight functions. It turns out that a stable inverse is obtained by considering the vanishing regularization parameter.Moreover, the use of this perturbation technique allows the correct evaluation of all necessary derivatives in interpolation points at a reasonable cost.Unlike standard kernel functions used in EFGM, RKPM, etc., the singular kernel functions lead to really interpolating functions which satisfy the Kronecker-delta property. They can be used for enforcement of Dirichlet boundary conditions when solving boundary value problems.Solution to a model BVP as well as an experimental convergence study of the method to analytical solutions, confirming the mathematical derivations, are given.

@article{Sulsky1994,
	Abstract = {A broad class of engineering problems including penetration, impact and large rotations of solid bodies causes severe numerical problems. For these problems, the constitutive equations are history dependent so material points must be followed; this is difficult to implement in a Eulerian scheme. On the other hand, purely Lagrangian methods typically result in severe mesh distortion and the consequence is ill conditioning of the element stiffness matrix leading to mesh lockup or entanglement. Remeshing prevents the lockup and tangling but then interpolation must be performed for history dependent variables, a process which can introduce errors. Proposed here is an extension of the particle-in-cell method in which particles are interpreted to be material points that are followed through the complete loading process. A fixed Eulerian grid provides the means for determining a spatial gradient. Because the grid can also be interpreted as an updated Lagrangian frame, the usual convection term in the acceleration associated with Eulerian formulations does not appear. With the use of maps between material points and the grid, the advantages of both Eulerian and Lagrangian schemes are utilized so that mesh tangling is avoided while material variables are tracked through the complete deformation history. Example solutions in two dimensions are given to illustrate the robustness of the proposed convection algorithm and to show that typical elastic behavior can be reproduced. Also, it is shown that impact with no slip is handled without any special algorithm for bodies governed by elasticity and strain hardening plasticity. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

Attention is given to the role of structure tensors (also called fabric tensors), especially in context of the Eshelby-Mandel stress and large inelastic volume changes attributable to porosity. Both (hyper-)elastic and inelastic orthotropic symmetry, reducing to the particular case of transverse isotropy, are considered. Specific material assumptions and constitutive choices are identified for the development of a novel Anisotropic Drucker-Prager/Cap (ADPC) model formulated within the intermediate configuration consistent with multiplicative split of the deformation gradient. The model is calibrated to existing experimental measurements, including high pressure large strain triaxial compression of lithographic (Solnhofen) limestone and triaxial compression measurements on Tournemire shale assessing elastoplastic anisotropy. Manifest implications of constitutive theory are investigated, including consequences of recognizing (or not) the Eshelby-Mandel stress as energy conjugate to the plastic velocity gradient and including (or not) contribution from the skew-symmetric parts of the Mandel stress to the plastic anisotropy. Numerical simple shear experiments and large deformation simulated indentation experiments are provided in order to investigate model predictions and demonstrate the overall robustness in finite element modeling.},

	Abstract = {For seepage failures of dike due to water level-up and rainfall, surface infiltration and strength change induced by suction reduction are important factors; thus, numerical analysis should consider the coupling of water and soil, as well as the effect of saturation to obtain more precise failure mechanism. Based on the advanced smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method, this work proposed a two-phase-coupled SPH model in coordination with a novel constitutive model for unsaturated soils. Then, a triaxial compression test is simulated to check the applicability of the SPH method on the soil phase. After that, the failure test of a dike due to water level-up is discretized and simulated, from which the seepage process, the distribution of maximum shear strain, the slip surface, and pore water pressure are obtained. The two-phase-coupled SPH model is also applied to a slope failure test of heavy rainfall, and the results are compared to the model test. Finally, a dike failure test due to rainfall is analyzed using the proposed SPH model to reproduce the surface infiltration and suction reduction. The proposed SPH model provides several insights of seepage failures and can be a helpful tool for the analysis of dike failures induced by water level-up and rainfall.},

Finally, it is shown that the use of a genetic algorithm to identify the soil parameters seems particularly suitable when the topology of the error function is complex.},

	Abstract = {The first detailed quantitative observations of the two-dimensional collapse of a granular column along a horizontal channel are presented for a variety of materials. Together with the complementary study for the axisymmetric situation, we conclude that for granular collapses the generally accepted approaches, that are highly dependent on frictional parameters, do not describe the main flow phenomena. The motion divides in two main flow regimes at a approximately 1.8, where the aspect ratio a = hi/di and hi and di are the initial height and width of the column. We describe the details of collapse by emphasizing the sequential occurrence of a main spreading followed by a final avalanching phase. For the low a regime, a {\textless} 1.8, we derive descriptions of the final geometry by direct physical arguments. For the large a regime, a {\textgreater} 1.8, we determine that nearly all details of the collapse, including the position of the flow front as a function of time, the emplacement time, the self-similar final profiles, and especially their maximum vertical and horizontal extension, are established during the spreading phase and can be expressed in terms of the initial geometrical parameters but are independent of basal and internal friction parameters.},

The step is initially held together with electromagnets, and released when the current is switched off. We visualize the surface and the motion of the grains during the entire relaxation. The initial failure occurs at the surface and the subsequent flow is also confined to the surface as the step relaxes to its final state. The final shape of the surface is almost linear, depends on the initial angle of the step, and is not sensitive to the size of the grains. The average final slope of the pile is only slightly lower than the angle of repose of a pile formed by slowly pouring particles on to a flat surface. The evolution of the step is compared with a proposed convective-diffusion model of our system. The qualitative features of the relaxation are captured by the model after a flow-dependent dissipation parameter is introduced.},

	Abstract = {Free-surface (unconfined) seepage problems are commonly encountered in geotechnical engineering. In these problems, the determination of the free-surface usually requires sophisticated numerical techniques. Among all the proposed methods for solving free-surface seepage problems, the extended pressure (EP) method emerges as one of the easiest methods since the boundary conditions are simply imposed on the prescribed outer boundaries and those on the prior unknown free-surface are automatically satisfied. However, in the available papers on the EP method, the optimal value of $\epsilon$ in the ramp function H$\epsilon$(p), which has significant effects on solving accuracy and computational efficiency, is rarely mentioned or simply selected as the grid spacing without a systematical analysis. In this paper, a modified EP method is proposed to improve the accuracy in simulating the free-surface and reduce the computational cost. In this modified EP method, $\epsilon$ is proposed as half of the under-grid spacing in y-direction through an error analysis of the finite difference equations and their iteration schemes. Compared with the original EP method, the modified EP method is more accurate and efficient due to its smooth free-surface, rational spillpoint position and low computational cost. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

The MPM helps to avoid mesh distortion and tangling problems related to Lagrangian methods and as well as the advection errors associated with Eulerian methods. Despite the MPM being promoted for its ability to solve large deformation problems the method suffers from instabilities when material points cross between elements. These instabilities are due to the lack of smoothness of the grid basis functions used for mapping information between the material points and the background grid. In this paper a novel high-order MPM is developed to eliminate the cell-crossing instability and improve the accuracy of the MPM method.},

Constitutive equations for porous materials possess a coupling between mechanical displacements for solid and fluid phases. The work is based on the u-u formulation and the incognita fields of the coupled analysis in focus are the solid skeleton displacements and the fluid displacements. Independent spatial discretization is considered for each phase of the model, rendering a more flexible and efficient methodology. Both displacements are approximated by the moving least-squares (MLS) scheme. The paper presents in the first time a general meshless method for the numerical analysis of axisymmetric problems in continuously nonhomogeneous saturated porous media. Numerical results are given for boreholes in continuously nonhomogeneous porous medium with prescribed misfit and exponential variation of material parameters in the excavation zone. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

In this scheme, the energy functional is approximated by a family of functionals depending on a small parameter and on two fields: the displacement field and an eigendeformation field that describes the fractures that occur in the body. Specifically, the eigendeformations allow the displacement field to develop jumps that cost no local elastic energy. However, this local relaxation requires the expenditure of a certain amount of fracture energy. We provide a construction, based on the consideration of {\$}\backslashvarepsilon{\$}-neighborhoods of the support of the eigendeformation field, for calculating the right amount of fracture energy associated with the eigendeformation field. We prove the {\$}\backslashGamma{\$}-convergence of the eigendeformation functional sequence, and of finite element approximations of the eigendeformation functionals, to the Griffith-type energy functional introduced in Francfort and Marigo [J.

	Abstract = {This paper presents the results of an experimental and numerical investigation on the collapse of dykes involving soft soils. Nine centrifuge tests were carried out to investigate the dyke-subsoil interaction. The tests consisted in placing a dyke made out of Speswhite clay or Baskarp sand on a subsoil. The dykes and the subsoils were alternatively changed to explore the different contrast in stiffness ranging from stiff dykes on soft subsoil to soft dykes on stiff subsoils. The small scale models were placed in the centrifuge and were progressively accelerated up to a maximum of 100 G. The recordings, which were then processed by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV), offered an insight onto the deformation and failure mechanisms. The results showed that dykes placed on a stiff subsoil underwent brittle failures with the development of slip surfaces whereas the same dyke placed on a soft subsoil underwent large deformation which presented a serviceability issue. These tests were then modelled with the Material Point Method (MPM), which is a continuum-based method for numerical simulation dedicated for large deformation problems. Simple constitutive models were used for which the parameters could be estimated using state indices.},

@article{Sulsky1996,
	Abstract = {The material point method is an evolution of particle-in-cell methods which utilize two meshes, one a material or Lagrangian mesh defined over material of the body under consideration, and the second a spatial or Eulerian mesh defined over the computational domain. Although meshes are used, they have none of the negative aspects normally associated with conventional Eulerian or Lagrangian approaches. The advantages of both the Eulerian and Lagrangian methods are achieved by using the appropriate frame for each aspect of the computation, with a mapping between the two meshes that is performed at each step in the loading process. The numerical dissipation normally displayed by an Eulerian method because of advection is avoided by using a Lagrangian step; the mesh distortion associated with the Lagrangian method is prevented by mapping to a user-controlled mesh. Furthermore, explicit material points can be tracked through the process of deformation, thereby alleviating the need to map history variables. As a consequence, problems which have caused severe numerical difficulties with conventional methods are handled fairly routinely. Examples of such problems are the upsetting of billets and the Taylor problem of cylinders impacting a rigid wall. Numerical solutions to these problems are obtained with the material point method and where possible comparisons with experimental data and existing numerical solutions are presented.},

Having defined a body as contactor and the other as target, it is assumed that contact forces are developed between contactor nodes and target surface. The method is based on stiffness transformation and eliminating the normal degree of freedom of contactor node. The method is absolutely general and can be used in static and dynamic nonlinear problems. All the drawbacks of Lagrange multipliers and Penalty method are vanished in this technique and it can be easily implemented in computer programs. The efficiency and applicability of the method is demonstrated by several illustrative examples. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science S.A. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Dynamic failure can be divided into three classes: failure in tension, in compression, and in shear. The principal physical phenomena involved in dynamic failure are identified, and the mechanical models which incorporate them are reviewed. Dynamic failure of ductile metals in tension takes place by the nucleation, growth, and coalescence of voids. For brittle materials, it takes place by the nucleation, growth, and coalescence of cracks. In dynamic failure by shear, adiabatic shear bands play a key role, and their evolution in a number of materials is reviewed. Microstructural elements affect both the initiation and propagation of shear bands, which are precursors to shear and tensile failure. Compressive failure is very important in brittle materials and occurs by the activation of existing flaws in the microstructure. Compressive failure in rocks and ceramics is described. The effects of grain size, phase transformations, heat treatments, second-phase particles, porosity and existing flaws on dynamic failure are discussed.},

	Abstract = {The non-linear behaviour of statically loaded concrete results mainly from the development of cracks. In addition, highly dynamically loaded concrete is influenced by the failure of micro-pores. Several authors use a damage model to consider both effects. The objective of this work is to test the capability of a discrete crack model to simulate shock wave-loaded concrete. Discrete cracks are modelled using the element-free Galerkin method, which allows cracks to be implemented independently of the mesh. The discrete crack model is used in combination with a fracture process zone to simulate the cohesive behaviour of the cracks in concrete. The behaviour of the micro-pores is described by a compression modulus, which depends on hydrostatic strain (Hugoniot curve). The strain rate effect is considered by modifying the failure surface for calculating crack development. Static and dynamic benchmarks with several concrete beams show good agreement with experimental results. Experiments with concrete loaded by contact detonation show the development of cracks below the crater. The simulation model used shows good agreement with the experimental crack pattern. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The material point method (MPM) combines an Eulerian and a Lagrangian description of the dynamic behaviour of materials. In recent years it has been extended to solve problems in soil mechanics. In particular, a code has been developed to analyse the response of saturated soils (Jassim, et al., 2012). The method is well adapted to deal with large displacements. MPM has a good potential to examine the conditions leading to slope failure but, also, it is capable of following in time the evolution of the unstable mass determining its final run-out, which is a key variable to evaluate the consequences of instability. Recently, a novel feature has been implemented in the code to simulate the excavation of soil. Within this work, the Selborne experiment has been modelled in order to contribute in the validation of the new excavation feature and the Mohr-Coulomb Strain Softening constitutive model. Furthermore, the influence of the initial stresses on the generated slip surface and the post-failure behaviour is studied. Key},

	Abstract = {Stress oscillations are a common phenomenon in the material point method (MPM), since this numerical method typically uses regular finite element (FE) shape functions to map variables from surrounding nodes to material points and vice versa, independently of the locations of the material points within an element. In integration this leads to a quadrature rule error and, in strain and stress calculations, derivatives of typical FE shape functions are discontinuous across element boundaries and do not give accurate results away from Gauss point locations within elements. In geotechnical analysis, the constitutive behaviour is generally stress-dependent, and therefore stress oscillations can cause severe inaccuracies in the calculated mechanical behaviour, including the development of wrong elasto-plastic quantities. Several attempts to improve stress recovery and reduce quadrature errors have been developed, but seldom has a full comparison between methods been made. In this paper, benchmark small scale and slope stability problems have been examined in order to compare the relative performance of the classic material point method (MPM), the generalized interpolation material point (GIMP) method and the new compound material point method (CMPM).},

The provided phenomenological framework allows for volumetric damage associated with pore growth to be distinguished from the isochoric damage associated with distributed microcracks, and a novel Drucker-Prager/cap type material model that includes damage evolution is presented. The model is shown to capture well the hardening/softening behavior and pressure dependence of the so-called brittle-ductile transition by comparison with confined triaxial compression measurements from the literature.

For the general case of irregular geometry and unstructured node distribution, the local form of RBF-DQ was used. The multiquadric type of radial basis functions was selected for the computations, and the results were compared with analytical, finite element method, and existing numerical solutions from the literature. Results of this study show that localized RBF-DQ can produce accurate results for the analysis of seepage. The method is meshfree and easy to program, but as with previous applications of RBFs, requires careful selection of suitable shape parameters. A practical method for estimating suitable shape parameters is discussed.

We introduce a dilational/deviatoric splitting of the con-stitutive model and show that an implicit treatment of the Eulerian evolution of the dilational part can be used to simulate arbitrarily in-compressible materials. Furthermore, we show that this treatment reduces to a parabolic equation for moderate compressibility and an elliptic, Chorin-style projection at the incompressible limit. Since projections are naturally done on marker and cell (MAC) grids, we devise a staggered grid MPM method. Lastly, to generate varying material parameters, we adapt a heat-equation solver to a material point framework.},

To investigate the effect of dilatancy angle on the footing bearing capacity, two series of analyses were performed, one using an associated flow rule and one using a non-associated flow rule. The study focuses on the values of the bearing capacity factors Nq and N$\gamma$ and of the shape factors sq and s$\gamma$ for circular footings.

	Abstract = {Material point method is a variant of the finite element method (FEM) and is successfully applied in large deformation problems. Recently, material point method has been applied in a wide range of engineering applications including solid and solid-fluid interaction problems. However, describing the behavior of incompressible materials is a challenging problem in MPM. The explicit formulation and the linear elements used in the standard MPM exhibit numerical instabilities such as mesh locking and artificial pressure oscillations in material incompressibility. Further, the small time step used to obtain a reasonable numerical stability limits the application of MPM in problems particularly with long time durations. We present an implicit treatment of the pressure term in MPM to mitigate the numerical instabilities and small time steps in incompressible material problems. The set of velocity-pressure coupled governing equations resulted by the implicit formulation is solved using Choin's projection method. The numerical examples show that the present MPM implementation is capable of modeling incompressible materials without pressure oscillations using a significantly large time step.},

	Abstract = {We develop and analyse a composite 'CT3D' tetrahedral element consisting of an ensemble of 12 four-node linear tetrahedral elements, coupled to a linear assumed deformation defined over the entire domain of the composite element. The element is designed to have well-defined lumped masses and contact tractions in dynamic contact problems while at the same time, minimizing the number of volume constraints per element. The relation between displacements and deformations is enforced weakly by recourse to the Hu-Washizu principle. The element arrays are formulated in accordance with the 'assumed-strain' prescription. The formulation of the element accounts for fully non-linear kinematics. Integrals over the domain of the element are computed by a five-point quadrature rule. The element passes the patch test in arbitrarily distorted configurations. Our numerical tests demonstrate that CT element has been found to possess a convergence rate comparable to those of linear simplicial elements, and that these convergence rates are maintained as the near-incompressible limit is approached. We have also verified that the element satisfies the Babuska-Brezzi condition for a regular mesh configuration. These tests suggest that the CT3D element can indeed be used reliably in calculations involving near-incompressible behaviour which arises, e.g., in the presence of unconfined plastic flow.

	Abstract = {Large deformation problems in granular soils are of great interest in the field of geotechnical engineering since most of them cause catas- trophic damages. Among them, Geophysical and gravity-driven flows such as landslides, avalanches, flowslides, and debris flows; seepage failures in mad-made structures such as levees, dikes, and embank- ments; and liquefaction of loose saturated granular soils have been extensively studied by researches. Both experimental and numerical investigations are very important to understand the mechanics and to predict failures of these problems. However, the dynamics of these problems during the failure are less explored. Experimental investi- gations on these types of large scale problems are difficult to perform and require large quantity of resources. Numerical modelling can be used to study these problems, and most of the research related to nu- merical modelling is mainly focused on identifying the unstable limit due to the limitations of the numerical methods. The material point method (MPM) is a novel numerical method that combines the best aspects of Lagrangian and Eulerian techniques and can be applied to model large deformation problems. This research consists of four main contributions in the study of large deformation problems in granular soils. First, it investigates the applicability of using continuum approaches to model dry granular flow problems us- ing MPM. Second, a fully coupled formulation is derived for MPM to model large deformation problems in fluid-saturated soils. Third, the proposed coupled MPM is implemented along with advanced features to apply for a wide range of applications and verified with analyti- cal solutions. Fourth, the coupled MPM is used to model river levee failure problems that involve large deformations.},

These studies were conducted by simulation of shaking table tests using the material point method (MPM), which allows seamless treatment of various considerations, from elastic behavior to discontinuous collapse behavior of slopes, on the basis of an elasto-plastic constitutive law. The simulation results showed that the failure modes, progressive deformation and downward sliding of the numerical slope models, which were similar to that observed in the shaking table tests, can be obtained using the numerical method. In addition, sensitivity analyses of the numerical models used in this study were performed to determine the effects of mesh size, number of particles per cell (PPC) and damping constants on the simulation results. The results of these analyses indicated the use of fine meshes and high damping constants seems to produce sensible results and reduce numerical noises, respectively.},

A popular and efficient strategy is the modified Newton Raphson approach of which a key element is the integration of the constitutive laws over a finite strain step. Two algorithms for performing such an integration are the 'substepping' and 'return' methods. In this paper the basic assumptions behind these methods are described and the associated errors compared. This comparative study is undertaken both at a fundamental level and when applied to a typical boundary value problem. The errors associated with both methods are increment size dependent. It is shown in the problems considered that for a particular increment size, the 'substepping' method is the more accurate. {\textcopyright} 1994.},

@article{Bonet2001,
	Abstract = {The paper discusses the problem of tension instability of particle-based methods such as smooth particle hydrodynamics (SPH) or corrected SPH (CSPH). It is shown that tension instability is a property of a continuum where the stress tensor is isotropic and the value of the pressure is a function of the density or volume ratio. The paper will show that, for this material model, the non-linear continuum equations fail to satisfy the stability condition in the presence of tension. Consequently, any discretization of this continuum will result in negative eigenvalues in the tangent stiffness matrix that will lead to instabilities in the time integration process. An important exception is the 1-D case where the continuum becomes stable but SPH or CSPH can still exhibit negative eigenvalues. The paper will show that these negative eigenvalues can be eliminated if a Lagrangian formulation is used whereby all derivatives are referred to a fixed reference configuration. The resulting formulation maintains the momentum preservation properties of its Eulerian equivalent. Finally a simple 1-D wave propagation example will be used to demonstrate that a stable solution can be obtained using Lagrangian CSPH without the need for any artificial viscosity.

	Abstract = {We introduce a class of block preconditioners for accelerating the iterative solution of coupled poromechanics equations based on a three-field formulation. The use of a displacement/velocity/pressure mixed finite-element method combined with a first order backward difference formula for the approximation of time derivatives produces a sequence of linear systems with a 3×3 unsymmetric and indefinite block matrix. The preconditioners are obtained by approximating the two-level Schur complement with the aid of physically-based arguments that can be also generalized in a purely algebraic approach. A theoretical and experimental analysis is presented that provides evidence of the robustness, efficiency and scalability of the proposed algorithm. The performance is also assessed for a real-world challenging consolidation experiment of a shallow formation.},

	Abstract = {The flow of granular solids within rigid walls is modeled using continuum mechanics. The problem is represented as a viscoplastic flow in which the discontinuity function is taken as in previous works by Gray and Stiles, while the flow rule is modeled by the von-Mises criterion. The resulting model is incompressible and based on non-associated viscoplasticity. The apparent viscosity results in a non-linear function of the second invariant of the symmetric rate of deformation tensor and of the pressure. Friction, cohesion and fluidity of the granular model are taken into account. The constitutive model has been implemented assuming steady-state, in which the granular material flows under a critical state (incompressible behavior). Discretization of the problem has been carried out by finite elements, with direct iteration techniques to solve the non-linear system of equations. The model has been applied to the massive flow of granular material stored in vertical silos and hoppers with axisymmetric or planar shape. Comparisons with experimental tests performed by other authors are presented, together with parametric investigations to identify the main variables affecting the response.},

	Abstract = {Uniaxial quasi-static compression, uniaxial dynamic compression and confined dynamic compression experiments were performed to characterize the failure of Aluminum Nitride (AlN) using a servo hydraulic machine and a modified Kolsky bar set-up respectively. High-speed digital cameras are used to visualize the failure processes. A summary of the available experimental results, including that in the literature, shows that the compressive strength of the AlN is sensitive to strain rate in the range from 10-3 to 103 s-1, and that the deviatoric strength of AlN is linearly dependent on pressure at low pressures and nearly independent of pressure above a transitional pressure (about 2 GPa). TEM characterization of fragments obtained after dynamic loading is used to characterize the deformation mechanisms in the AlN for varying confinement. The transition in the pressure dependent behavior is shown to be the result of a change of deformation mechanism. Classical wing crack micromechanics is used to predict the transition in the deformation mechanism, and to explain the observed behavior at low pressure. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {SUMMARY The object of this work is to establish a meshfree framework for solving coupled, steady and transient prob-lems for unconfined seepage through porous media. The Biot's equations are formulated in displacements (or u w) assuming an elastic solid skeleton. The free surface location and its evolution in time are obtained by interpolation of pore water pressures throughout the domain. Shape functions based on the principle of local maximum entropy are chosen for the meshfree approximation schemes. In order to avoid the locking involved in the fluid phase of the porous media, a B-bar based algorithm is devised to compute the average volumetric strain in a patch composed of various integration points. The efficiency of such an implemen-tation for one phase problems is shown through the Benchmark problem, Cook's membrane loaded by a distributive shear load. The proposed methodology is firstly applied to various classical examples in uncon-fined steady seepage problems through earth dams, then to the dynamic consolidation of a soil column. The results obtained for both problems are quite satisfactory and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed method in solving coupled problems in porous media.},

The interaction between a structural element and soil is investigated to validate the applicability of the parallelisation strategy. Two techniques are developed to parallelise the interpolation from soil particles to nodes to avoid a data race; the technique that is based on workload parallelisation across threads over the nodes has a higher computational efficiency. Benchmark problems of surface footing penetration and a submarine landslide are analysed to quantify the speedup of GPU parallel computing over sequential simulations on the central processing unit.

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Society of Civil Engineers. An anisotropic plasticity model is proposed to describe the fabric effect on sand behavior under both monotonic and cyclic loading conditions within the framework of anisotropic critical state theory. The model employs a cone-shaped bounding surface in the deviatoric stress space and a yield cap perpendicular to the mean stress axis to describe sand behavior in constant mean stress shear and constant stress ratio compression, respectively. The model considers a fabric tensor characterizing the internal structure of sand associated with the void space system and its evolution with plastic deformation. The fabric evolution law is assumed to render the fabric tensor to become codirectional with the loading direction tensor and to reach a constant magnitude of unit at the critical state. In constant stress ratio compression, the final degree of anisotropy is proportional to a normalized stress ratio. An anisotropic variable defined by a joint invariant of the fabric tensor and loading direction tensor is employed to describe the fabric effect on sand behavior in constant mean stress monotonic and cyclic shear. A systematic calibrating procedure of the model parameters is presented. Satisfactory comparison is found between the model simulations and test results on Toyoura sand in both monotonic and cyclic loadings with a single set of parameters. The important role of fabric and fabric evolution in capturing the sand behavior is highlighted. Limitations and potential improvement of the model in describing cyclic mobility of very dense sand and sand behavior in nonproportional loading have been discussed.},

@article{Liang2019a,
	Abstract = {The material point method (MPM) has demonstrated itself as an effective numerical method to simulate extreme events with large deformations. However, the original MPM suffers the cell crossing noise because it takes the material points as integration points and employs the piecewise linear grid nodal shape functions whose gradient is discontinuous on the cell boundary. A number of techniques have been developed to alleviate the cell crossing noise. In this paper, a new staggered grid material point method (SGMP) is proposed to eliminate the cell crossing noise very efficiently. The volume integrals in the weak form are evaluated by cell center quadrature instead of particle quadrature as the sum of value of the integrand at each cell center of the background grid multiplied by the corresponding quadrature weight. The physical quantities and the quadrature weights at the cell centers are reconstructed efficiently based on an auxiliary grid, which is obtained by shifting the background grid half the side length of its cell in each direction. Similar to the original MPM, both grids carry no permanent information and can be reset after each time step. In addition, the SGMP evaluates the constitutive equations at the particles, just like the original MPM, to readily model the history-dependent materials. To further reduce the cell crossing noise, a continuous strain rate/vorticity field is established based on the auxiliary grid, whose values are determined by the background grid velocity gradient. The strain rate/vorticity at each particle is interpolated from the auxiliary grid nodal values. Due to the overlap of the cell centers and the corresponding auxiliary grid nodes, a very efficient implementation is established in the SGMP. Numerical studies illustrate that the SGMP is capable of eliminating the cell crossing noise with little extra computational effort and the extra cost ratio reduces as the number of the grid cells or the particles increases.},

The provided hyper-elastoplastic/damage framework is motivated by a desire to ensure thermodynamic consistency of model predictions, and is shown to satisfy the principle of maximum plastic dissipation, enabling enforcement of the plastic dissipation (and Clausius--Planck) inequality. A small strain Eshelby-like stress is derived as being energy-conjugate to the plastic strain rate, and relation to the damage-energy release rate is exploited to pose a coupled damage/yield MCC criteria (MCC-D). Relations between volumetric damage and porosity changes are examined, along with a method for estimating the damage state from bulk moduli measurements. The model is shown to simulate well existing high pressure compression measurements of Boulder clay, and connections between damage-related model parameters and behavior exemplifying different microstructural states is examined through numerical experiments.},

	Abstract = {Development of more accurate mathematical models of discrete granular material behavior requires a fundamental understanding of deformation and strain localization phenomena. This paper utilizes a meso-scale finite element modeling approach to obtain an accurate and thorough capture of deformation and strain localization processes in discrete granular materials such as sands. We employ critical state theory and implement an elastoplastic constitutive model for granular materials, a variant of a model called "Nor-Sand", allowing for non-associative plastic flow and formulating it in the finite deformation regime. Unlike the previous versions of critical state plasticity models presented in a series of "Cam-Clay" papers, the present model contains an additional state parameter $\psi$ that allows for a deviation or detachment of the yield surface from the critical state line. Depending on the sign of this state parameter, the model can reproduce plastic compaction as well as plastic dilation in either loose or dense granular materials. Through numerical examples we demonstrate how a structured spatial density variation affects the predicted strain localization patterns in dense sand specimens. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {The densification phenomenon in dry or completely drained sands mainly occurs when these materials are subjected to dynamic loadings. This fact induces a reduction of voids volume and consequently the compaction of the soil. The Generalized Endochronic densification law, formulated in cylindrical coordinates, has been used in a finite element model for simulating vibroflotation soil improvement techniques. The effects of vibrations at a point inside the soil mass, like those applied in vibroflotation treatment, are reproduced with this code. Absorbing boundary conditions are established at those borders where spatial domain finishes, aiming to avoid spurious, artificial reflections of stress waves, which otherwise come into the domain, disturbing the computed results. A mean densification function is defined for each spatial domain, to evaluate the effect of this technique, and also employed to optimize the distance between vibration points. This is a new rational design approach, which represents a step forward development if it is compared with the usual empirical employed procedures. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

The solid is characterized by an elastic-viscoplastic constitutive law and the plane ahead of the crack tip is embedded with a rate dependent fracture process zone. The macroscopic work of fracture of the material is computed as a function of the crack velocity and the parameters characterizing the fracture process zone and the solid. With increasing crack velocity a competition exists between the strain rate hardening of the solid, which causes elevated tractions ahead of the crack tip that tend to drive crack propagation, and the rate strengthening of the fracture process zone which tends to resist fracture. Results for material parameters characteristic of polymers show that the toughness of the material can either increase or decrease with increasing crack velocity. To motivate the model, the cohesive zone parameters are discussed in terms of failure mechanisms such as crazing and void growth ahead of the crack tip. The toughness of rubber modified epoxies is explained by employing the fracture model along with micromechanical void cell calculations.},

The influence of two viscous parameters, which can be determined by undrained triaxial compression tests, was studied.

	Abstract = {The aim of the present study is twofold. Firstly, the paper investigates the undrained cyclic and post-cyclic behaviour of two silica sands by means of multi-stage cyclic triaxial tests. Secondly, based on the post-cyclic response observed in the element test, the authors formulate a simplified stress-strain relationship that can be conveniently used for the construction of p-y curves for liquefiable soils. The multi-stage loading condition consists of an initial cyclic loading applied to cause liquefaction, followed by undrained monotonic loading that aimed to investigate the post-cyclic response of the liquefied sample. It was found that due to the tendency of the liquefied soil to dilate upon undrained shearing, the post-liquefaction strain-stress response was characterised by a distinct strain-hardening behaviour. The latter is idealized by means of a bi-linear stress-strain model, which can be conveniently formulated in terms of three parameters, i.e.: (i) take-off shear strain, $\gamma$to, i.e. shear strain required to mobilize 1kPa of shear strength; (b) initial secant shear modulus, G1, defined as 1/$\gamma$to; (c) post-liquefied shear modulus at large strain, G2 ($\gamma$≫$\gamma$to). Based on the experimental results, it is concluded that these parameters are strongly influenced by the initial relative density of the sample, whereby $\gamma$to decreases with increasing relative density. Differently both shear moduli (G1 and G2) increases with increasing relative density. Lastly, the construction of new p-y curves for liquefiable soils based on the idealized bi-linear model is described. {\textcopyright} 2014 .},

	Abstract = {The random material point method (RMPM), which combines random field theory and the material point method (MPM), is proposed. It differs from the random finite-element method (RFEM), by assigning random field (cell) values to material points that are free to move relative to the computational grid rather than to Gauss points in a conventional finite-element mesh. The importance of considering the effects of both large deformations and the spatial variability of soil strength properties in slope stability analyses is highlighted, by comparing RMPM solutions with RFEM and deterministic MPM solutions for an idealised strain-softening clay slope characterised by a spatially varying undrained shear strength. The risks posed by potential slides are quantified by the extent of retrogressive failure -- that is, due to the tendency for secondary failures to be triggered by the removal of support from the remaining soil mass caused by the initial failure. The results show that RMPM provides a much wider range of solutions, in general increasing the volume of material in the failure compared with the RFEM solutions, which are usually limited to the initial slide. Moreover, the anisotropic nature of soil heterogeneity is shown to have a significant influence on the nature and extent of failure.

	Abstract = {A dynamic frictionless contact problem between a viscoelastic body and a rigid obstacle is numerically studied in this paper. The contact is modelled using an adapted unilateral contact law in terms of velocities in order to obtain some energy conservation properties. The variational formulation is briefly recalled. Then, a fully discrete scheme is introduced based on the finite element method to approximate the spatial variable and the midpoint scheme to discretize the time derivatives. Error estimates are derived on the approximative solutions from which the linear convergence of the algorithm is deduced under suitable regularity conditions. Furthermore, we focus our interest on the analysis of the discrete energy evolution and the presentation of an adapted numerical algorithm. Finally, a representative two-dimensional example is presented to demonstrate the accuracy and the energy consistent properties of the numerical scheme. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {We present a finite element model for the analysis of a mechanical phenomenon involving dynamic expulsion of fluids from a fully saturated porous solid matrix in the regime of large deformation. Momentum and mass conservation laws are written in Lagrangian form by a pull-back from the current configuration to the reference configuration following the solid matrix motion. A complete formulation based on the motion of the solid and fluid phases is first presented; then approximations are made with respect to the material time derivative of the relative flow velocity vector to arrive at a so-called (v,p)-formulation, which is subsequently implemented in a finite element model. We show how the resulting finite element matrix equations can be consistently linearized, using a compressible neo-Hookean hyperelastic material with a Kelvin solid viscous enhancement for the solid matrix as a test function for the nonlinear constitutive model. Numerical examples are presented demonstrating the significance of large deformation effects on the transient dynamic responses of porous structures, as well as the strong convergence profile exhibited by the iterative algorithm. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {Two-dimensional discrete and continuum modelling of excavator bucket filling is presented. The discrete element method (DEM) is used for the discrete modelling and the material-point method (MPM) for continuum modelling. MPM is a so-called particle method or meshless finite element method. Standard finite element methods have difficulty in modelling the entire bucket filling process due to large displacements and distortions of the mesh. The use of a meshless method overcomes this problem. DEM and MPM simulations (plane strain) of bucket filling are compared to two-dimensional experimental results. Cohesionless corn grains were used as material and the simulated force acting on the bucket and flow patterns were compared with experimental results. The corn macro (continuum) and micro (DEM) properties were obtained from shear and oedometer tests. As part of the MPM simulations, both the classic (nonpolar) and the Cosserat (polar) continuums were used. Results show that the nonpolar continuum is the most accurate in predicting the bucket force while the polar and DEM methods predict lower forces. The DEM model does not accurately predict the material flow during filling, while the polar and nonpolar methods are more accurate. Different flow zones develop during filling and it is shown that DEM, the polar and the nonpolar methods can accurately predict the position and orientation of these different flow zones. {\textcopyright} 2006 ISTVS.},

In addition to some elementary examples, we analyze the maximum-entropy reconstruction of the density of states in harmonic solids and of dynamic correlation functions in quantum spin systems. We also briefly indicate possible applications to the Lee--Yang theory of Ising models, to the summation of divergent series, and so on.

Stress-velocity-pore pressure formulations in FE analysis provide accurate results for wave propagation and failure analysis. However, finite elements present important limitations when deformations are large.

The finite element formulation for the incremental elastoviscoplastic analysis is reformulated, through the application of the Hellinger--Reissner variational theorem, as an equivalent optimisation program that can be solved efficiently using modern algorithms such as the interior-point method. The recast formulation is then incorporated into the framework of the particle finite element method for investigating progressive failure problems related to sensitive clays, such as the collapse of a sensitive clay column and the retrogressive failure of a slope in sensitive clays, where extremely large deformation occurs.

The comparison of different time interpolation functions shows that the mixed interpolation gives more stable response.

The presented second-order MPM uses a special set of piecewise quadratic shape functions to circumvent the well-known issue of producing zero nodal mass contributions. To mitigate the effect of the standard MPM to produce highly oscillating stresses across cell interfaces, we have carried over our ideas obtained from the derivation of the second-order MPM to the Dual Domain Material Point (DDMP) Method, too. The resulting second-order DDMP Method produces a smoother stress distribution across the entire computational domain while being able to profit from the improved convergence rates of second-order finite elements. In a numerical example from geotechnical engineering applications, we illustrate the practical application of our enhanced Material Point and DDMP Methods by simulating a cone penetration.},

A PIC update filters velocity in each time step, which causes unwanted numerical diffusion, while FLIP eliminates that diffusion, but may retain too much noise. This paper develops a new particle update termed XPIC(m) (for eXtended PIC of order m) because it generalizes PIC updates. XPIC(1) is identical to current PIC methods, but higher orders of XPIC(m) address the over filtering and numerical diffusion of PIC, while still filtering out noise caused by the nontrivial null space of the extrapolation matrix used in MPM. As m→∞, XPIC(m) converges to a modified FLIP update with orthogonal removal of null space noise. The frequency response and filtering properties of XPIC(m) are investigated and several numerical examples demonstrate its advantages over other update methods.},

	Abstract = {Many natural and man-made materials, such as sand, rock, concrete and bone, are multiconstituent, fluid-infiltrated porous solids. The failure of such materials is important for various engineering applications, such as CO2 sequestration, energy storage and retrieval and aquifer management as well as many other geotechnical engineering problems aimed to prevent catastrophic failures due to pore pressure build-up. This dissertation investigates two mechanical aspects of fluid infiltrated porous media, i.e., the predictions of diffuse and localized failures of porous media and the heterogeneous microstructures developed after failures. We define failures as material conditions in which homogeneous deformation becomes unattainable. To detect instabilities, a critical state plasticity model for sand is implemented. By seeking bifurcation points of the incremental, linearized constitutive responses, we establish local criteria that detect onsets of drained soil collapse, static liquefaction and formation of deformation bands under locally drained and undrained conditions. Fully undrained and drained triaxial compression simulations are conducted and the stability of the numerical specimens are assessed via a perturbation method. To characterize deformation modes after failures, a multi-scale framework is designed to determine microstructural attributes from pore space extracted from X-ray tomographic images and improve the accuracy and speed of a multi-scale lattice Boltzmann/finite element hierarchical flow simulation algorithm. By comparing the microstructural attributes and macroscopic permeabilities inside and outside a compaction band formed in Aztec Sandstone, our numerical study reveals that elimination of connected pore space and increased tortuosity are the main causes that compaction bands are flow barriers.},

In the spatial domain, a diagonalization method is applied to both the mass and the fluid compressibility matrices by neglecting the interactions between adjacent nodes in the finite element model of FSPM for the first time. In the time domain, an explicit-explicit algorithm consisting of the central and the unilateral difference methods is applied to solve the dynamic u-p equations. The stability and accuracy of the proposed explicit-explicit algorithm are discussed. Moreover, five numerical examples were presented in this paper. The good agreements between the results obtained from the proposed method and the existing explicit-implicit method indicate that the diagonalization method for the fluid compressibility matrix and the proposed completely explicit method are validity in solving the dynamic u-p equations of FSPM.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, a comprehensive account on using mesh-free methods to simulate strain localization in inelastic solids is presented. Using an explicit displacement-based formulation in mesh-free computations, high-resolution shear-band formations are obtained in both two-dimensional (2-D) and three-dimensional (3-D) simulations without recourse to any mixed formulation, discontinuous/incompatible element or special mesh design. The numerical solutions obtained here are insensitive to the orientation of the particle distributions if the local particle distribution is quasi-uniform, which, to a large extent, relieves the mesh alignment sensitivity that finite element methods suffer.Moreover, a simple h-adaptivity procedure is implemented in the explicit calculation, and by utilizing a mesh-free hierarchical partition of unity a spectral (wavelet) adaptivity procedure is developed to seek high-resolution shear-band formations. Moreover, the phenomenon of multiple shear band and mode switching are observed in numerical computations with a relatively coarse particle distribution in contrast to the costly fine-scale finite element simulations.

Such an algorithm presents the advantage of being noniterative while, the contact configuration evolves rapidly, and the conditional stability is not a disadvantage since time steps must be small enough anyway for an accurate computation. But during the springback simulation, an implicit method, which is iterative, presents the advantage of unconditional stability. The optimal solution is then to have both implicit and explicit methods readily available in the same code and to be able to switch automatically from one to the other. Criteria that decide to switch from a method to another, depending on the current dynamic, have been developed. Implicit restarting conditions are also proposed that annihilate numerical oscillations resulting from an explicit calculation. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier B.V. All right reserved.},

The meshless method greatly reduces the mesh distortion or entanglement encountered in using the finite element method for large deformation nonlinear analysis and structural shape design optimization. The DSA method of Grindeanu et al. (Grindeanu, I., Chang, K.-H., Choi, K. K., and Chen, J.-S., 'Design Sensitivity Analysis of Hyperelastic Structures Using a Meshless Method,' AIAA Journal, Vol. 36, No. 4, 1998, pp. 618-627) is extended by using a pressure projection method to avoid volumetric locking for nearly incompressible materials without the need for large support sizes for the meshless shape functions and to reduce the CPU time. The Lagrange multiplier method is used to impose the essential boundary conditions. An engine mount is employed as an example to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed optimization method. The mass is minimized subject to constraints on hydrostatic pressure and stiffness characteristics of the component. The design velocity fields corresponding to the shape design parameters are obtained using the Design Sensitivity Analysis and Optimization tool. Shape design optimization is carried out using the modified feasible direction of the Design Optimization Tool.},

	Abstract = {This study explains from the fracture mechanics principles that the common size effect observed in fracture toughness and energy measurements of many engineering materials including concrete, fiber reinforced composites and even coarse-grained ceramics are in fact similar to what has been observed in the well-studied elastic--plastic fracture of metals. The conditions required for measurements of the material constant, the plane strain fracture toughness KIC, of metals are akin to those required to avoid such a size effect on the fracture toughness and energy of concrete and other composites. Using the common yield strength and plain strain fracture toughness criteria a reference crack length a∗ is defined in this study, which is then used to introduce a simple asymptotic function. The asymptotic analysis shows that the size effect on fracture toughness and energy of a heterogeneous material such as concrete will be inevitable if the relative crack measured by the crack ratio a/a∗ or the remaining ligament ratio W−a/a∗ is too close to one. This relative crack needs to be around 10 or even higher to avoid the size effect influence. Experimental results and previous models are compared with the current asymptotic analysis.},

	Abstract = {The material point method, which combines features of finite-element and particle discretisation methods, has been extended to solve coupled flow-deformation problems in granular media. The method is applied to simulate the construction and failure of the Aznalc{\'{o}}llar dam. The brittle foundation clay is characterised by means of a strain-softening Mohr--Coulomb elasto-plastic model. The rupture process of the foundation is associated with a progressive failure mechanism. The model predicts the development of a localised shearing band that initiates at the toe of the dam at some intermediate stage of construction, and propagates downstream and upstream. The shape and position of the failure surface reproduce actual field observations.},

@article{Fuentes2018,
	Abstract = {The ISA-plasticity is a mathematical platform which allows to propose constitutive models for soils under a wide range of strain amplitudes. This formulation is based on a state variable, called the intergranular strain, which is related to the strain recent history. The location of the intergranular strain can be related to the strain amplitude, information which is used to improve the model for the simulation of cyclic loading. The present work proposes an ISA-plasticity-based model for the simulation of saturated clays and features the incorporation of a viscous strain rate to enable the simulation of the strain rate dependency. The work explains some aspects of the ISA-plasticity and adapts its formulation for clays. At the beginning, the formulation of the model is explained. Subsequently, some comments about its numerical implementation and parameters determination are given. Finally, some simulations are performed to evaluate the model performance with two different clays, namely a Kaolin clay and the Lower Rhine clay. The simulations include monotonic and cyclic tests under oedometric and triaxial conditions. Some of these experiments include the variation of the strain rate to evaluate the viscous component of the proposed model.},

	Abstract = {The first critical state models for describing the behaviour of soft soils such as clay, the Cam-Clay (CC) and Modified Cam-Clay (MCC) were formulated by researchers at Cambridge University. Both models describe three important aspects of soil behaviour: (i) Strength (ii) Compression or dilatancy (the change of volume that occurs with shearing), and (iii) Critical states in which soil elements can experience unlimited deformations without any changes in stress or volume. A large proportion of the volume occupied by a soil mass consists of voids that may be filled by fluids (primarily air and water). As a result, deformations in soil are accompanied by significant, and often non-reversible, volume changes. A major advantage of cap plasticity models, a class to which the CC and MCC formulations belong, is their ability to model volume changes more realistically. The},

	Abstract = {A rate-independent constitutive model for natural clays is presented, formulated within the framework of kinematic hardening with elements of bounding surface plasticity, The modelling framework is intended to include effects of damage to structure caused by irrecoverable plastic strains caused by sampling, laboratory testing, or geotechnical loading. The incorporation of a structure measure allows the size of the bounding surface to decay with plastic deformations. This model can be seen as a logical extension from the Cam-clay model. The steady fall of stiffness with strain towards the Cam-clay value is controlled by a particular interpolation function. This ensures a smooth degree of approach between a kinematically hardening bubble (which is the boundary of the elastic region) and the bounding surface during their relative translation with stress history. The model describes the essential phenomena of pre-failure behaviour of natural clays: stiffness variation with strain, volumetric change accompanying distortion, peak strength at small strains. illustrative numerical results for common geotechnical experiments on a low-sensitivity Swedish clay demonstrate the potential of the proposed model.},

	Abstract = {Three-point bending tests on notched beams of a high-strength concrete have been conducted using both a servo-hydraulic machine and a self-designed drop-weight impact device. The fracture energy and the peak load were measured over a wide range of loading point displacement rates, spanning eight orders of magnitude. Under low displacement rates, from 10-4 to 10 mm/s, the tests were performed with the servo-hydraulic machine; from 102 to 103 mm/s we used the drop-weight impact machine. The results show that the fracture energy and the peak load increase as the loading rate increases. Nevertheless, such a trend is relatively slight under low rates and can be attributed to viscous effects mainly originating from the presence of water in the pore structure. Under high rates the increases in the fracture energy and in the peak load are dramatic due to the effect of inertia. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {For many geotechnical problems involving fully saturated soil, the behavior of the soil has to be modeled as a two-phase material to reproduce the soil behavior realistically. Especially when considering dynamic loading conditions a two-phase approach is of importance in order to capture effects such as soil liquefaction or time-dependent soil compaction. The governing equations of a u-p formulation using Darcy's flow law are derived. The u-p formulation is implemented within a dynamic total stress analysis using an explicit time integration rule. The approach is applied on the problem of one-dimensional wave propagation. The influence of different constitutive models for the solid phase as well as the influence of the relative density and the hydraulic conductivity on the wave propagation is studied. Effects such as the development of shock waves are investigated. Additionally, the problem of a vibrating foundation on a halfspace of fully saturated soil is investigated. Effects such as soil liquefaction and time-depended soil compaction can be modeled. In order to evaluate fully saturated soil under dynamic loading regarding soil liquefaction or soil compaction, the application of a coupled two phase analysis under partially drained conditions is of importance. Despite the limitations of the application of a u-p formulation in case of dynamic problems, a u-p formulation is an attractive way to model fully saturated soil under dynamic loading due to the much more simple formulation.},

	Abstract = {The value of energy and momentum conserving algorithms has been well established for the analysis of highly non-linear systems, including those characterized by the nonsmooth non-linearities of an impact event. This work proposes an improved integration scheme for frictionless dynamic contact, seeking to preserve the stability properties of exact energy and momentum conservation without the heretofore unavoidable compromise of violating geometric admissibility as established by the contact constraints. The physically motivated introduction of a discrete contact velocity provides an algorithmic framework that ensures exact conservation locally while remaining independent of the choice of constraint treatment, thus making full conservation equally possible in conjunction with a penalty regularization as with an exact Lagrange multiplier enforcement. The discrete velocity effects are incorporated as a post-convergence update to the system velocities, and thus have no direct effect on the non-linear solution of the displacement equilibrium equation. The result is a robust implicit algorithmic treatment of dynamic frictionless impact, appropriate for large deformations and fully conservative for a range of geometric constraints.

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg. An anisotropic time-dependent bounding surface model for clays is developed by generalizing a previous time-independent model that adopts a flexible bounding surface. It is based on the framework for coupled elastoplasticity--viscoplasticity for clays and Perzyna's overstress theory. Three viscoplastic parameters were introduced and explained in detail. The model was validated against undrained creep tests for both isotropically and anisotropically consolidated clays, undrained and drained stress relaxation tests on some undisturbed clays, and undrained triaxial tests with varying strain rates on natural Hong Kong marine deposit clay. The general agreement between the model simulations and test results was satisfactory. The varying effects of lower-level parameters were discussed on the undrained multistage stress relaxation response for normally consolidated soils which had been ignored in literature. The flexibility of the model in capturing the shear strengths, which is the unique feature of the current model, was shown in the simulations of time-dependent triaxial tests on Taipei silty clay. All the simulations show that the proposed model is a relatively practical model considering both anisotropy and time dependency of clays.},

The basic equations have been derived on the basis of Biot's linear theory of poro-elasticity and then solved using Fourier complex transform for the horizontal direction. The importance of a number of soil characteristics including compressibility, degree of saturation and soil permeability has been examined. It is shown that the effect of pore fluid is dominant only for fully saturated soils with incompressible solid grains and low permeability. For partially saturated, compressible or very permeable soils, the stresses would be mainly transferred to solid part and there will be considerable reduction in pore pressure amplitude.},

@article{Sulsky:07,
	Abstract = {The material-point method (MPM) is a numerical method for continuum mechanics that combines the best aspects of Lagrangian and Eulerian discretizations. The material points provide a Lagrangian description of the ice that models convection naturally. Thus properties such as ice thickness and compactness are computed in a Lagrangian frame and do not suffer from errors associated with Eulerian advection schemes, such as artificial diffusion, dispersion, or oscillations near discontinuities. This desirable property is illustrated by solving transport of ice in uniform, rotational and convergent velocity fields. Moreover, the ice geometry is represented by unconnected material points rather than a grid. This representation facilitates modeling the large deformations observed in the Arctic, as well as localized deformation along leads, and admits a sharp representation of the ice edge. MPM also easily allows the use of any ice constitutive model. The versatility of MPM is demonstrated by using two constitutive models for simulations of wind-driven ice. The first model is a standard viscous-plastic model with two thickness categories. The MPM solution to the viscous-plastic model agrees with previously published results using finite elements. The second model is a new elastic-decohesive model that explicitly represents leads. The model includes a mechanism to initiate leads, and to predict their orientation and width. The elastic-decohesion model can provide similar overall deformation as the viscous-plastic model; however, explicit regions of opening and shear are predicted. Furthermore, the efficiency of MPM with the elastic-decohesive model is competitive with the current best methods for sea ice dynamics.},

The project showed that centrifuge studies are repeatable only under carefully controlled conditions. Most procedures were able to predict the onset of liquefaction in contractive soils, but only effective stress based fully coupled nonlinear procedures were able to predict deformations due to liquefaction. None of the currently available procedures could simulate the behavior of dilative soils adequately. Problems were attributed to improper constitutive model implementation and inadequate calibration. An example to evaluate the behavior of a flow shde observed in a dynamic centrifuge test is presented. Numerical simulations of deformations with a fimte deformation formulation showed that the main core of the embankment remained stable after shaking.

Three types of instabilities were identified in one dimension: an instability due to rank deficiency, a tensile instability and a material instability which is also found in continua. The stability of particle methods with Eulerian and Lagrangian kernels is markedly different: Lagrangian kernels do not exhibit the tensile instability. In both kernels, the instability due to rank deficiency can be suppressed by stress points. In two dimensions the stabilizing effect of stress points is dependent on their locations. It was found that the best approach to stable particle discretizations is to use Lagrangian kernels with stress points. The stability of the least-squares stabilization was also studied.

	Abstract = {In this thesis we develop a stabilised finite element method for solving the equations of poroelasticity to enable solving complex models of biological tissues such as the human lungs. For the proposed numerical scheme, we use the lowest possible approximation order: piecewise constant approximation for the pressure, and piecewise linear continuous elements for the displacements and fluid flux. Due to the discontinuous pressure approximation, sharp pressure gradients due to changes in material coefficients or boundary layer solutions can be captured reliably. We begin by developing theoretical results for approximating the linear poroelastic equations valid in small deformations. In particular, we prove existence and uniqueness, an energy estimate and an optimal a-priori error estimate for the discretised problem. We then extend this work and construct a stabilised finite element method to solve the poroelastic equations valid in large deformations. We present the linearisation and discretisation for this nonlinear problem, and give a detailed account of the implementation. We rigorously test both the linear and nonlinear finite element method using numerous test problems to verify theoretical stability and convergence results, and the method's ability to reliably capture steep pressure gradients. Finally, we derive a poroelastic model for lung parenchyma coupled to an airway fluid network model, and develop a stable method to solve the coupled model. Numerical simulations, on a realistic lung geometry, illustrate the coupling between the poroelastic medium and the network flow model, and simulations of tidal breathing are shown to reproduce global physiologically realistic measurements. We also investigate the effect of airway constriction and tissue weakening on the ventilation, tissue stress and alveolar pressure distribution.},

	Abstract = {Behavior of impact and explosion is complicated and usually involves large deformation and multi- material interaction of different phases. Failure and fragmentation of structure caused by impact or explosion also need to be considered. Simulation of impact and explosion problem requires a powerful numerical tool. The material point method, MPM, combines the advantages of Eulerian and Lagrangian description of motion. It eliminates the drawbacks of numerical difficulties associated with mesh distortion and element entanglement in Lagrangian and with the advected quantities in Eulerian description. Therefore the MPM is well suitable to the impact and explosive problems, which involves large deformation and interaction of different materials. A three dimensional material point method code, MPM3D, is developed. The linear hardening plasticity, Johnson-Cook plasticity and high explosive material model are implemented. Three kinds of equation of state (EOS) are implemented to calculate the pressure of different materials under extreme load. They are Gruneisen EOS for solid material, JWL EOS for explosive products, linear polynomial EOS for air. Numerical examples including Taylor bar impact, debris cloud and cylinder test are given to investigate the performance of MPM3D, which show that MPM is much more efficient than FEM and SPH in simulating hypervelocity impact and explosion problems, especially in large scale problems.},

	Abstract = {Domain integration by Gauss quadrature in the Galerkin mesh-free methods adds considerable complexity to solution procedures. Direct nodal integration, on the other hand, leads to a numerical instability due to under integration and vanishing derivatives of shape functions at the nodes. A strain smoothing stabilization for nodal integration is proposed to eliminate spatial instability in nodal integration. For convergence, an integration constraint (IC) is introduced as a necessary condition for a linear exactness in the mesh-free Galerkin approximation. The gradient matrix of strain smoothing is shown to satisfy IC using a divergence theorem. No numerical control parameter is involved in the proposed strain smoothing stabilization. The numerical results show that the accuracy and convergent rates in the mesh-free method with a direct nodal integration are improved considerably by the proposed stabilized conforming nodal integration method. It is also demonstrated that the Gauss integration method fails to meet IC in mesh-free discretization. For this reason the proposed method provides even better accuracy than Gauss integration for Galerkin mesh-free method as presented in several numerical examples.

	Abstract = {This work is concerned with the formulation of a general framework for the analysis of meshfree approximation schemes and with the convergence analysis of the local maximum-entropy (LME) scheme as a particular example. We provide conditions for the convergence in Sobolev spaces of schemes that are n-consistent in the sense of exactly reproducing polynomials of degree less than or equal to n ≥ 1 and whose basis functions are of rapid decay. The convergence of the LME in {\$}W{\^{}}{\{}1,p{\}}{\_}{\{}loc{\}}(\backslashOmega){\$} follows as a direct application of the general theory. The analysis shows that the convergence order is linear in h, a measure of the density of the point set. The analysis also shows how to parameterize the LME scheme for optimal convergence. Because of the convex approximation property of LME, its behavior near the boundary is singular and requires additional analysis. For the particular case of polyhedral domains we show that, away from a small singular part of the boundary, any Sobolev function can be approximated by means of the LME scheme. With the aid of a capacity argument, we further obtain approximation results with truncated LME basis functions in H1(Ω) and for spatial dimension d{\textgreater} 2.},

	Abstract = {A theory is developed for the propagation of stress waves in a porous elastic solid containing a compressible viscous fluid. The emphasis of the present treatment is on materials where fluid and solid are of comparable densities as for instance in the case of water-saturated rock. The paper denoted here as Part I is restricted to the lower frequency range where the assumption of Poiseuille flow is valid. The extension to the higher frequencies will be treated in Part II. It is found that the material may be described by four nondimen- sional parameters and a characteristic frequency. There are two dilatational waves and one rotational wave. The physical interpretation of the result is clarified by treating first the case where the fluid is frictionless. The case of a material containing a viscous fluid is then developed and discussed numerically. Phase velocity dispersion curves and attenuation coefficients for the three types of waves are plotted as a function of the frequency for various combinations of the characteristic parameter},

	Abstract = {We describe a finite element-based method to propagate multiple fractures simultaneously. The algorithm is iterative and it simulates sub-critical quasi-static crack propagation. The matrix is homogeneous and isotropic, and behaves linear elastically. The algorithmic cornerstones are a failure criterion, a propagation criterion, and a propagation angle. Fracture geometries are kept track of independently of the mesh allowing geometric handling of fracture arrest, closure, and coalescence. Fracture aperture is an emergent property of the model. The mesh is adaptively remeshed to capture variations in the geometry and displacement field. Generated patterns reproduce observed crack paths in physical experiments. Algorithm efficiency scales linearly. The model reproduces en-echelon crack linkage, fracture hooking, and orthogonal tip approximation patterns. Our numerical experiments closely match physical experiments. Remeshing consumes {\textless}2{\%} of the total computational time demonstrating current computational capabilities allow for discrete crack propagation to be viable for multiple crack propagation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {This paper presents the constitutive relations and the simulative potential of a new plasticity model developed mainly for the seismic liquefaction analysis of geostructures. The model incorporates the framework of critical state soil mechanics, while it relies on bounding surface plasticity with a vanished elastic region to simulate the non-linear soil response. Key constitutive ingredients of the new model are: (a) the inter-dependence of the critical state, the bounding and the dilatancy (open cone) surfaces on the basis of the state parameter $\Psi$, (b) a (Ramberg-Osgood type) non-linear hysteretic formulation for the "elastic" strain rate, (c) a discontinuously relocatable stress projection center related to the "last" load reversal point, which is used for mapping the current stress point on model surfaces and as a reference point for introducing non-linearity in the "elastic" strain rate and finally (d) an empirical index of the directional effect of sand fabric evolution during shearing, which scales the plastic modulus. In addition, the paper outlines the calibration procedure for the model constants, and exhibits its accuracy on the basis of a large number of laboratory element tests on Nevada sand. More importantly, the paper explores the potential of the new model by presenting simulations of the VELACS centrifuge tests of Models No 1 and 12, which refer to the free-field liquefaction response of Nevada sand and the seismic response of a rigid foundation on the same sand, respectively. These simulations show that the new model can be used successfully for the analysis of widely different boundary value problems involving earthquake soil liquefaction, with the same set of model constants calibrated on the basis of laboratory element tests. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

The method is based on Hill's variational principle for incremental deformations, and is ideally suited to isotropically hardening Prandtl-Reuss materials. Further, the formulation is given in a manner which allows any conventional finite element program, for "small strain" elastic-plastic analysis, to be simply and rigorously adapted to problems involving arbitrary amounts of deformation and arbitrary levels of stress in comparison to plastic deformation moduli. The method is applied to a necking bifurcation analysis of a bar in plane-strain tension. The paper closes with a unified general formulation of finite element equations, both Lagrangian and Eulerian, for large deformations, with arbitrary choice of the conjugate stress and strain measures. Further, a discussion is given of other proposed formulations for elastic-plastic finite element analysis at large strain, and the inadequacies of some of these are commented upon. {\textcopyright} 1975.},

@article{Pastor:2000,
	Abstract = {The accurate prediction of the behaviour of geostructures is based on the strong coupling between the pore fluid and the solid skeleton. If the relative acceleration of the fluid phase relative to the skeleton is neglected, the equations describing the problem can be written in terms of skeleton displacements (or velocities) and pore pressures. This mixed problem is similar to others found in solid and fluid dynamics. In the limit case of zero permeability and incompressibility of the fluid phase, the restrictions on the shape functions used to approximate displacements and pressures imposed by Babuska-Brezzi conditions or the Zienkiewicz-Taylor patch test hold. As a consequence, it is not possible to use directly elements with the same order of interpolation for the field variables. This paper proposes a generalization of the fractional-step method introduced by Chorin for fluid dynamics problems, which allows to circumvent BB restrictions in the incompressibility limit, thus making it possible to use elements with the same order of interpolation.},

We study master--slave couplings where particles are fixed across the FE boundary, coupling via interface shape functions such that consistency conditions are satisfied, bridging domain coupling, compatibility coupling with Lagrange multipliers and hybrid coupling methods where forces from the particles are applied via their shape functions on the FE nodes and vice versa. The hybrid coupling methods are well suited for large deformations and adaptivity and the coupling procedure is independent of the particle distance and nodal arrangement. We will study the methods for several static and dynamic applications, compare the results to analytical and experimental data and show advantages and drawbacks of the methods.

	Abstract = {This chapter describes the use of a patch of one or more elements to assess convergence of a finite element solution to that of the differential equation it approximates. The requirements are presented by a consistency and stability test on the resulting matrix problem. For elements which are numerically integrated or otherwise explicitly stated the stability test requires that the stiffness matrix of a structural problem or the conductivity matrix of a quasi-harmonic problem has proper rank. This requires the number of quadrature points to be equal or larger to some minimum value. Use of less than the minimum number is called reduced integration. Consistency requires the finite element solution to exactly represent all the derivatives up to the highest order that exists in a weak or variational expression for the problem. The chapter presents alternative methods to asses the two requirements. The patch test is an essential test to both test accuracy of the computer program used to solve problems as well as to validate formulations that violate the standard rules described in previous chapters. One such case of a non-conforming element is presented in the chapter.},

	Abstract = {The material point method (MPM) uses unconnected, Lagrangian, material points to discretize solids, fluids or membranes. All variables in the solution of the continuum equations are associated with these points; so, for example, they carry mass, velocity, stress and strain. A background Eulerian mesh is used to solve the momentum equation. Data mapped from the material points are used to initialize variables on the background mesh. In the case of multiple materials, the stress from each material contributes to forces at nearby mesh points, so the solution of the momentum equation includes all materials. The mesh solution then updates the material point values. This simple algorithm treats all materials in a uniform way, avoids complicated mesh construction and automatically applies a noslip contact algorithm at no additional cost. Several examples are used to demonstrate the method, including simulation of a pressurized membrane and the impact of a probe with a pre-inflated airbag.

	Abstract = {The development of stability problems related to classical mixed methods has recently been observed. In this study, a soil-water coupled boundary-value problem, one type of stability problem, is presented using the element-free Galerkin method (EFG method). In this soil-water coupled problem, anomalous behavior appears in the pressure field unless a stabilization technique is used. The remedy to such numerical instability has generally been to adopt a higher interpolation order for the displacements than for the pore pressure. As an alternative, however, an added stabilization term is incorporated into the equilibrium equation. The advantages of this stabilization procedure are as follows: (1) The interpolation order for the pore pressure is the same as that for the displacements. Therefore, the interpolation functions in the pore pressure field do not reduce the accuracy of the numerical results. (2) The stabilization term consists of first derivatives. The first derivatives of the interpolation functions for the EFG Method are smooth, and therefore, the solutions for pore pressure are accurate. In order to validate the above stabilization technique, some numerical results are given. It can be seen from the results that a good convergence is obtained with this stabilization term. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{Yamaguchi2019,
	Abstract = {An improved version of the solid--liquid coupled material point method (MPM) is proposed to simulate ground collapses with fluidization involving transition processes from soil structures to flowing mixture. A water-saturated soil is assumed based on porous media theory, and the physical quantities of the soil and water phases are assigned to two separate sets of particles (material points). The main contribution of this study is the introduction of the fractional step projection method for the time discretization of the momentum equation of the water phase on the assumption of incompressibility. Thanks to this, the proposed solid--liquid coupled MPM is capable of suppressing the pressure oscillations caused by the weak incompressibility of water, which is commonly assumed in the previous studies, and of representing the wide range of behavior of the soil--water mixture at relatively low computational cost. Also, B-spline basis functions are utilized for the spatial discretization to suppress the cell-crossing errors caused by particles crossing element (cell) boundaries. Several numerical tests are conducted to examine the performance of the proposed method that inherits the beneficial features of MPM and demonstrate the capability of reproducing a model experiment of wave collision to sandpile that exhibits the water flow-induced fluidization process of soil involving scouring, transportation and sedimentation.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes an alternative displacement formulation of Biot's linear model for poroelastic materials. Its advantage is a simplification of the formalism without making any additional assumptions. The main difference between the method proposed in this paper and the original one is the choice of the generalized coordinates. In the present approach, the generalized coordinates are chosen in order to simplify the expression of the strain energy, which is expressed as the sum of two decoupled terms. Hence, new equations of motion are obtained whose elastic forces are decoupled. The simplification of the formalism is extended to Biot and Willis thought experiments, and simpler expressions of the parameters of the three Biot waves are also provided. A rigorous derivation of equivalent and limp models is then proposed. It is finally shown that, for the particular case of sound-absorbing materials, additional simplifications of the formalism can be obtained.},

	Abstract = {This work presents a frictional extension of an improved conservative integration framework for dynamic contact, extending the details of the frictionless scheme to encompass Coulomb stick/slip friction and the associated conservation/dissipation. It addresses algorithmic details that do not appear in the frictionless context, establishing an appropriate and objective treatment of relative tangential motion that is necessary to rigorously ensure conservation of angular momentum in the fully discrete setting. It also further extends the functionality of a discrete contact velocity term proposed in the frictionless implementation, using it to preserve conservation or dissipation locally as warranted by the frictional model and effectively enabling an enforcement of the contact constraints independent of energy considerations. The result is a robust implicit algorithmic framework for dynamic frictional impact, viable for large deformation analysis, appropriately conservative or dissipative for both stick and slip phenomena on a local scale, and readily extensible to more complex frictional models. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science B.V.

@article{Larese2012,
	Abstract = {Rockfill dams are nowadays often preferred over concrete dams because of their economic advantages, their flexible design and thank to the great advance achieved in geosciences and geomechanics. Unfortunately their behavior in case of overtopping is still an open issue. In fact very little is known on this phenomenon that in most cases leads to the complete failure of the structure with catastrophic consequences in term of loss of lives and economic damage. The principal aim of the present thesis is the development of a computational method to simulate the overtopping and the beginning of failure of the downstream shoulder of a rockfill dam. The whole phenomenon is treated in a continuous framework. The fluid free surface problem outside and inside the rockfill slope is treated using a unique Eulerian fixed mesh formulation. A level set technique is employed to track the evolution of the free surface. The traditional Navier-Stokes equations are modified in order to automatically detect the presence of the porous media. The non-linear seepage is evaluated using a quadratic form of the resistance law for which the Ergun's coefficients have been chosen. The structural response of the solid skeleton is evaluated using a continuum viscous model. A non-Newtonian modified Bingham law is proposed for the simulation of the behaviour of a granular non-cohesive material. This approach has the possibility of considering a pressure sensitive resistance criteria. This is obtained inserting a Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion in the Bingham relation. Due to the large deformation of the mesh during the failure process, a Lagrangian framework is preferred to a fixed mesh one: the Particle Finite Element Method (PFEM) is therefore used. Its specific features make it appropriate to treat the rockfill material and its large deformations and shape changes. Finally a tool for mapping variables between non-matching meshes is developed to allow passing information between the fluid fixed and the dam moving meshes. All the numerical results are compared with experiments on prototype rockfill dams.},

	Abstract = {A theoretical and numerical framework to model the foundation of marine structures is presented. The theoretical framework includes two main components: (i) a mathematical model to properly represent soil skeleton-pore fluids interaction based on the Generalized Biot formulation, (ii) an advanced constitutive model to reproduce the nonlinear soil behavior based on the Generalized Plasticity framework. Apart from these two main components, suitable boundary conditions are of paramount importance. The proposed theoretical framework includes: (i) hydraulic boundary conditions to simulate the interaction between waves, sea bed and maritime structures, (ii) soil-structure interaction conditions to reproduce accurately the principal loads transmitted to the foundation, and (iii) radiation boundary conditions to make the computational domain finite. The finite element method is adopted in order to achieve accurate and robust approximate solutions of the governing equations. The proposed theoretical and numerical framework is applied to the analysis of the seaward tilt mechanism induced by the action of breaking waves over a vertical breakwater. The results numerically attained are in agreement with the main conclusions drawn from the literature associated with this failure mechanism. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Unconfined seepage through an earth dam or a levee is recognized as a challenging problem. This complexity is mainly due to the fact that determination of the phreatic line through the dam/levee body is not straightforward. For simulation purposes, mesh generation as well as accurate and smooth alteration of the phreatic line at the junction with the downstream slope (referred to as exit point) for an unconfined seepage problem with complex geometry generally makes cumbersome numerical solutions. This study presents an innovative boundary-type meshfree method to determine the phreatic line location in unconfined seepage problems. The current study explicitly addresses the problem that alternative methods commonly face to deal with the exit point. The method is developed based upon integrating the Method of Fundamental Solutions (MFS), Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm, and Thiele Continued Fractions (TCF). To accurately estimate the phreatic line location, the proposed framework uses MFS to solve the flow continuity equation, TCF to generate the phreatic line and PSO to optimize the phreatic line location generated by TCF. As a boundary method, MFS only deals with the boundaries of the domain and consequently, it only takes the exact position of phreatic line as a variable boundary. The proposed approach employs TCF to guarantee that the phreatic line is tangent to the downstream slope at the exit point, a characteristics which is important especially for the cases where abrupt changes occur in the phreatic line near the exit point. For comparison and validation purposes, the phreatic lines determined by the proposed approach for two unconfined seepage problems are compared and verified against those obtained from alternative analytical and numerical methods as well as a set of experimental results. An excellent agreement is demonstrated upon comparison of the proposed method to the results attained from the analytical solutions and experimental tests.},

	Abstract = {The set of differential equations from which we start the discretization process will determine whether we refer to the formulation as mixed or irreducible. Thus if we consider an equation system with several dependent variables u written as [see Eqs (3.1) and (3.2)] A ( u ) = 0 in domain $\Omega$ (10.1a) and ℬ ( u ) = 0 on boundary $\Gamma$ (10.1b) in which none of the components of u can be eliminated still leaving a well-defined problem, then the formulation will be termed irreducible. If this is not the case the formulation will be called mixed. These definitions were given in Chapter 3 (p. 56). Publisher Summary The aim of this chapter is to discuss mixed formulation and constraints. The set of differential equations from which the discretization process is started determines whether the formulation is referred to as mixed or as irreducible. This chapter demonstrates how elasticity problems can be dealt with in mixed form and shows how such formulations are essential in certain problems. If the operator specifying the mixed form is symmetric or self-adjoint, the formulation can proceed from the basis of a variational principle that can be directly obtained for linear problems. This chapter essentially outlines the mixed form of finite element formulation, which opens a new range of possibilities, many with potentially higher accuracy and robustness than those offered by irreducible forms. However, an additional advantage arises even in situations where, by the principle of limitation, the irreducible and mixed forms yield identical results. Therefore, the study of the behavior of the mixed form can frequently reveal weaknesses or lack of robustness in the irreducible form that otherwise would be difficult to determine. The mixed approximation expands the potential of the finite element method and presents almost limitless possibilities of detailed improvement.},

This is a new technique in the "eld of Computational Mechanics and can be considered as a meshless method. Unlike most of these methods, the NE shape functions are strictly interpolant and the essential boundary conditions can be imposed by directly substituting the corresponding terms in the system of equations. However, these shape functions are not strictly linear over non-convex boundaries and the approach does not make the test functions vanish over the whole essential boundary region. A modi"cation of the initial NEM version is considered based on ?-shapes and ?-complexes, which are widely used in the "eld of scienti"c visualization. Using ?-shapes in the context of the NEM allows the construction of models entirely in terms of nodes and also ensures the linear precision of the interpolant over convex and non-convex boundaries.

	Abstract = {This paper presents the results of a very recent experimental research program aimed at investigating mixed-mode fracture of reinforced concrete. The tests were designed so that only one single mixed-mode crack generates and propagates through the specimen, as opposed to the usual dense crack pattern found in most of the tests in scientific literature. The specimens were three-point-bend beams of three different sizes. They were notched asymmetrically and reinforced with various ratios of longitudinal and inclined reinforcement. These experiments may help to understand the mechanisms of crack initiation and propagation through reinforcing bars under mixed-mode load conditions. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {The particle-in-cell method (PIC), especially the latest version of it, the material point method (MPM), has shown significant advantage over the pure Lagrangian method or the pure Eulerian method in numerical simulations of problems involving large deformations. It avoids the mesh distortion and tangling issues associated with Lagrangian methods and the advection errors associated with Eulerian methods. Its application to multiphase flows or multi-material deformations, however, encounters a numerical difficulty of satisfying continuity requirement due to the inconsistence of the interpolation schemes used for different phases. It is shown in Section 3 that current methods of enforcing this requirement either leads to erroneous results or can cause significant accumulation of errors. In the present paper, a different numerical method is introduced to ensure that the continuity requirement is satisfied with an error consistent with the discretization error and will not grow beyond that during the time advancement in the calculation. This method is independent of physical models. Its numerical implementation is quite similar to the common method used in Eulerian calculations of multiphase flows. Examples calculated using this method are presented.},

Although several analytical and numerical solutions are available to predict the performance of stone column--improved soft ground, these models are incapable of capturing the influence of cyclic loading on transport corridors, such as highways and railways. The authors developed a novel finite-difference model adopting modified Cam clay theory to analyze the response of stone column--reinforced soft soil under static and cyclic loadings. Apart from predicting excess pore water pressure dissipation and the resulting settlement, the model also captures the effect of cyclic loading by considering yield surface contraction. The solutions developed were validated using available field observations and laboratory test results. The model was successfully applied to a selected case study at the Australian National Field Testing Facility at Ballina, New South Wales, Australia. The limitations of the proposed model are highlighted as well.},

In this paper, we investigate the null-space errors present in MPM solutions. The paper establishes a null-space stability condition which is used to examine the null-space errors in different versions of the MPM. This analysis shows that a B-splines MPM satisfies the null-space stability condition and therefore reduces greatly the errors associated with the null-space. In contrast, the MPM, the Generalized Interpolation Material Point Method (GIMP) and the Dual Domain Material Point Method (DDMP) show non-trivial null-spaces in the mapping. To remove the null-space errors, this paper utilizes QR factorization method, which is similar to the Single Value Decomposition (SVD) method, but requires fewer computations. This paper simulates several problems with hydro-mechanical coupled Dual Domain Material Point Method (DDMP) formulation both with and without null-space error reduction. The simulations indicate that the null-space filter can improve significantly the accuracy of the pore water pressure for both gravity loading and consolidation in large strain simulation.},

	Abstract = {Boundaries and boundary conditions are an aspect of the numerical solution of partial differential equations where meshless methods have had to surmount many initial difficulties due to the lack of a finite-element-like Kronecker delta condition. Furthermore, it is frequently desirable, especially in fluid mechanics, to impose general, nonlinear boundary and interface constraints. This paper describes a computationally efficient algorithm based on d'Alembert's principle that can be used for general constraints both in meshless methods and finite elements. First, a method of partitioning meshless shape functions suitable for imposing linear boundary conditions is developed. Subsequently, an analogous method is developed for nonlinear constraints. Special attention is given to imposing general boundary and fluid - structure interface conditions on the Navier-Stokes equations in terms of conservative variables. Numerical results using d'Alembert's principle with the Reproducing Kernel Particle Method (RKPM), including viscous, supersonic flow past a NACA 7012 airfoil, are shown. {\textcopyright} 1998 Elsevier Science S.A.

	Abstract = {This paper presents a method for incorporating dual-phase u-U wave propagation analysis for saturated porous media in commercial codes. Biot's formulation is first re-formulated in terms of effective stress and pore pressure, followed by its finite element discretization. The method of incorporating the dual-phase computation involves representing the solid and pore fluid phases by two overlapping meshes with collocated elements and nodal points. Viscous coupling between the solid and fluid phases are realized by connecting each pair of collocated nodal points using viscous Cartesian connectors. Volumetric compatibility between the solid and fluid phases is enforced by coding the behaviour of the two phases and their volumetric interaction within a user-defined material subroutine. Non-linear behaviour of the soil skeleton can also be prescribed within the same subroutine. Comparison with existing analytical or numerical solutions for three one-dimensional elastic problems shows remarkably good agreement. Finally, a three-dimensional elasto-plastic example involving impulsive surface loading on dry sand overlying saturated sand, which is akin to a dynamic compaction problem, is analyzed to demonstrate the potential application of the u-U analysis on a more realistic transient loading problem. The results of the analysis highlight the importance of the slow wave in dynamic compaction process. Although this approach was developed on the ABAQUS Explicit platform, it is, in principle, applicable to other existing codes with the right features. Its main advantage is that users can still access the computational functionalities and stability, as well as pre- and post-processing features that often come with commercial codes. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Experimental observations of the collapse of initially vertical columns of small grains are presented. The experiments were performed mainly with dry grains of salt or sand, with some additional experiments using couscous, sugar or rice. Some of the experimental flows were analysed using high-speed video. There are three different flow regimes, dependent on the value of the aspect ratio a = h i /r i , where h i and r i are the initial height and radius of the granular column respectively. The differing forms of flow behaviour are described for each regime. In all cases a central, conically sided region of angle approximately 59 * , corresponding to an aspect ratio of 1.7, remains undisturbed throughout the motion. The main experimental results for the final extent of the deposit and the time for emplacement are systematically collapsed in a quantitative way independent of any friction coefficients. Along with the kinematic data for the rate of spread of the front of the collapsing column, this is interpreted as indicating that frictional effects between individual grains in the bulk of the moving flow only play a role in the last instant of the flow, as it comes to an abrupt halt. For a {\{}{\textless}{\}} 1.7, the measured final runout radius, r ∞ , is related to the initial radius by r ∞ = r i (1 + 1.24a); while for 1.7 {\{}{\textless}{\}} a the corresponding relationship is r ∞ = r i (1 + 1.6a 1/2). The time, t ∞ , taken for the grains to reach r ∞ is given by t ∞ = 3(h i /g) 1/2 = 3(r i /g) 1/2 a 1/2 , where g is the gravitational acceleration. The insights and conclusions gained from these experiments can be applied to a wide range of industrial and natural flows of concentrated particles. For example, the observation of the rapid deposition of the grains can help explain details of the emplacement of pyroclastic flows resulting from the explosive eruption of volcanoes.},

	Abstract = {This is the second edition of the valuable reference source for numerical simulations of contact mechanics suitable for many fields like civil engineering, car design, aeronautics, metal forming, or biomechanics. Boundary value problems involving contact are of great importance in industrial applications in engineering such as bearings, metal forming processes, rubber seals, drilling problems, crash analysis of cars, rolling contact between car tires and the road, cooling of electronic devices... Other applications are related to biomechanical engineering design where human joints, implants or teeth are of consideration. Due to this variety, contact problems are today combined either with large elastic or inelastic deformations including time dependent responses. Thermal coupling also might have to be considered. Even stability behaviour has to be linked to contact. The topic of computational contact is described in depth providing an up-to-date treatment of different formulations, algorithms and discretisation techniques for contact problems which are established in the geometrically linear and nonlinear range. This book provides the necessary continuum mechanics background which includes the derivation of the contact constraints. Constitutive equations stemming from tribology which are valid at the contact interface are discussed in detail. Discretization schemes for small and finite deformations are discussed in depth. Solid and beam contact is considered as well as contact of unstable systems and thermomechanical contact. The algorithmic side covers a broad range of solution methods. Additionally adaptive discretisation techniques for contact analysis are presented as a modern tool for engineering design simulations. The present text book is written for graduate, Masters and PhD students, but also for engineers in industry, who have to simulate contact problems in practical application and wish to understand the theoretical and algorithmic background of contact treatment in modern finite element systems. For this second edition, illustrative simplified examples and new discretisation schemes as well as adaptive procedures for coupled problems are added. {\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2006.

	Abstract = {A modification to the nonlinear Pastor-Zienkiewicz-Chan (PZC) constitutive model without any change in the number of model parameters is introduced in order to simulate stiffness degradation of dense sands at dynamic loading. The PZC model is based on generalized plasticity and was verified by good prediction of liquefaction and undrained behavior of saturated sand. The PZC is a robust model that can predict drained dynamic behavior of sands, especially stiffness increase in loose sand at reloading of dynamic loading. Yet, this model does not show stiffness degradation of dense sand at reloading. The modification is made through modifying the stress memory factor, H DM , which is multiplied by the plastic modulus, H L . This modification does not influence reloading behavior of loose sand. The modified PZC model is verified via results of drained cyclic tests. Two cyclic triaxial tests on loose and dense specimens, along with two cyclic plane strain tests on dense sand are utilized for validation. The model simulation shows that the modified PZC model is able to predict the stiffness degradation of dense sand at reloading well. {\textcopyright} 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.},

On the theoretical side, we develop closed-form expressions for the tangent moduli which appear not to have been previously recorded in full generality in the literature. Quasi-incompressible response is accounted for by means of a three-field variational principle which makes use of a multiplicative decomposition of the deformation gradient into volume preserving and dilatational parts. The incompressible limit is enforced by means of a simple and effective augmented Lagrangian procedure. Two possible implementations are discussed.

Die beiden Phasen des por{\"{o}}sen Mediums werden als inkompressibel angesehen, d. h., die mikroskopischen Dichten der realen Materialien sind konstant.

Unter der Voraussetzung, da{\ss} sich das Festk{\"{o}}rperskelett linear elastisch verh{\"{a}}lt, k{\"{o}}nnen sich in diesem Medium eine gekoppelte P-Typ-Welle und eine gekoppelte S-Typ-Welle ausbreiten. Die Struktur der ebenen inhomogenen Wellen wird ausf{\"{u}}hrlich diskutiert. Das Verschiebungsfeld f{\"{u}}r jede Welle ist durch einen komplexen Amplitudenvektor und einen komplexen Wellenvektor charakterisiert. Der komplexe Wellenvektor umfa{\ss}t einen realen Ausbreitungsvektor sowie einen realen D{\"{a}}mpfungsvektor. Es wird gezeigt, da{\ss} jede gekoppelte Welle inhomogen ist, da die Ebenen der konstanten Phasen im allgemeinen nicht parallel zu den Ebenen der konstanten Amplituden sind. Dieser Effekt basiert auf dem Dissipationsmechanismus des Modells. Die Spur des bewegten Teilchens f{\"{u}}r jede Wellenart ist elliptisch polarisiert in Verbindung mit dem entsprechenden komplexen Amplitudenvektor. Die Energiebilanz f{\"{u}}r das gesamte por{\"{o}}se Medium wird ohne Ber{\"{u}}cksichtigung des thermischen Austauschs entwickelt.

In this paper inhomogeneous plane waves, energy flux, and energy dissipation in a liquid-saturated porous medium are investigated. The two-phase porous medium is described by an incompressible porous media model in which the microscopic density of each real material is assumed unchangeable whereas the respective macroscopic density may change in relation with the volume fractions. Within the context of a linearly elastic solid skeleton a coupled longitudinal (P-type) wave and a coupled transversal (S-type) wave may propagate in the medium and the structure of plane inhomogeneous waves is intensively discussed. The displacement field for each type of waves is characterized in terms of a complex-valued amplitude vector and a complex-valued wave vector which includes a real-valued propagation vector and a real-valued attenuation vector. It is shown that each coupled wave is inhomogeneous as the planes of constant phase are in general not parallel to the planes of constant amplitude due to the dissipative property of the porous medium. The trace of the particle motion for each type of waves is of elliptical polarization associated with the complex-valued amplitude vector. The energy conservative equation for the entire porous medium is developed without considering the thermal exchange. The energy flux vector and the energy dissipation rate are thus defined in the general form. The explicit expressions of the mean energy flux vector and the mean energy dissipation rate are given over a complete period for each type of the inhomogeneous waves.},

	Abstract = {This paper describes a fully implicit stress-point integration algorithm for a class of anisotropic bounding surface plasticity models with ellipsoidal loading function. The plasticity model is coupled with ?? nonlinear hyperelastic model to ensure that the elastic component of the combined model is energy-conserving. A key feature of the integration algorithm for the combined model is a return mapping in strain space, which allows fully implicit integration and consistent linearization of the constitutive equations. For this class of bounding surface models the consistency condition on the bounding surface is shown to be mathematically equivalent to the consistency condition on the loading surface, thus allowing practically all attributes of the standard return mapping algorithm of classical plasticity theory to be carried over to the bounding surface theory with little modification. As a specific example, the infinitesimal version of modified Cam-Clay theory is used to represent the bounding surface model, and an exponential function is used to interpolate the plastic modulus on the loading surface. Isoerror maps are generated describing the accuracy of the integration algorithm on the stress-point level. Finally, a boundary-value problem involving a strip footing on lightly overconsolidated clay is analyzed to demonstrate the robustness of the algorithm in a finite element setting. ?? 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

After a sudden removal of the lock gate, a gravity current, undular bore, or solitary wave develops, depending on the ambient fluid height in the channel. The temporal evolution of the moving front has been measured and evaluated. It was observed that the dilution using a very small amount (a few weight ppm) of a long chain polymer (polyethylene- oxide) in the fluid strongly affected flow properties. Pro- nounced drag reduction has been found in dry bed flows (whereas the polymer increased the viscosity of the fluid). The presence of a few mm-thick ambient fluid layer in the channel effectively destroyed drag reduction, in spite of the fact that strong turbulence was obvious and the propagation velocity of the front was almost unchanged.},

	Abstract = {Numerical prediction of dynamic behavior of fully coupled saturated porous media is of great importance in many engineering problems. Specifically, static and dynamic response of soils -- porous media with pores filled with fluid, such as air, water, etc. -- can only be modeled properly using fully coupled approaches. Modeling and simulation of static and dynamic behavior of soils require significant Verification and Validation (V{\&}V) procedures in order to build credibility and increase confidence in numerical results. By definition, Verification is essentially a mathematics issue and it provides evidence that the model is solved correctly, while Validation, being a physics issue, provides evidence that the right model is solved. This paper focuses on Verification procedure for fully coupled modeling and simulation of porous media. Therefore, a complete Solution Verification suite has been developed consisting of analytical solutions for both static and dynamic problems of porous media, in time domain. Verification for fully coupled modeling and simulation of porous media has been performed through comparison of the numerical solutions with the analytical ones. Modeling and simulation is based on the so called, u--p--U formulation. Of particular interest are numerical dispersion effects which determine the level of numerical accuracy. These effects are investigated in detail, in an effort to suggest a compromise between numerical error and computational cost.},

	Abstract = {A robust and efficient integration method, named quadratically consistent one-point (QC1) scheme, which evaluates the Galerkin weak form only at the centers of background triangle elements (cells) is proposed for meshfree methods using quadratic basis. The strain at the evaluation points is approximated by corrected (smoothed) nodal derivatives which are determined by a discrete form of the divergence theorem between nodal shape functions and their derivatives in Taylor's expansion. We prove that such smoothed nodal derivatives also meet the differentiation of the approximation consistency (DAC). The same Taylor's expansion is applied to the weak form and the smoothed nodal derivatives are used to compute the stiffness matrix. The proposed QC1 scheme can pass both the linear and the quadratic patch tests exactly in a numerical sense. Several examples are provided to demonstrate its better numerical performance in terms of convergence, accuracy, efficiency and stability over other one-point integration methods in the meshfree literature, especially its superiority over the existing linearly consistent one-point (LC1) quadratures. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier B.V..},

By using a reasonable assumption, we derive a one-dimensional rod equation as the model equation by taking integrations to the field equations. Then, we manage to solve exactly this nonlinear equation together with the boundary conditions. Solutions expressed in terms of the elliptic integrals of the first and third kinds are obtained. Graphic results are presented and some interesting phenomena are observed. For example, it is found that in the middle portion of the rod the azimuthal stretch is almost constant when the radius-length ratio is relatively small. An asymptotic analysis is conducted to deduce simple asymptotic formulae. Then, we are able to offer satisfactory analytical explanations for those interesting physical phenomena. Comparisons between the analytical results given in this paper and existing results are presented at the end.},

Based on the concept of deviatoric/volumetric split and the replacement of the compatible deformation gradient with an assumed modified counterpart, the formulation developed is applicable to arbitrary material models. The closed form of the corresponding exact tangent stiffnesses, which have a particularly simple structure, is derived. It ensures asymptotically quadratic rates of convergence of the Newton-Raphson scheme employed in the solution of the implicit finite element equilibrium equations. From a practical point of view, the incorporation of the proposed elements into existing codes is straightforward. It requires only small changes in the routines of the standard displacement based 4-node quadrilateral and 8-node brick. A comprehensive set of numerical examples, involving hyperelasticity as well as multiplicative elasto-plasticity, is provided. It illustrates the performance of the proposed elements over a wide range of applications, including strain localisation problems, metal forming simulation and adaptive analysis.

Based on the two-phase theory of Biot, we analytically derive the spectral response of a column made of nearly saturated poroelastic soils as a function of soil stiffness, degree of saturation, porosity, specific gravity, and permeability. A parametric study determines the influence of these parameters on the fundamental period, maximum amplitude, energy dissipation, damping factor, and maximum pore pressure. In departure from common beliefs in soil dynamics, we conclude that the soil-water damping within fully-saturated sands is not negligible compared to structural hysteretic damping. {\textcopyright} 1995.},

	Abstract = {Smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) is a meshless Lagrangian method that has been successfully applied to computational fluid dynamics (CFD), solid mechanics and many other multi-physics problems. Using the method to solve transport phenomena in process engineering requires the simulation of several days to weeks of physical time. Based on the high computational demand of CFD such simulations in 3D need a computation time of years so that a reduction to a 2D domain is inevitable. In this paper gpuSPHASE, a new open-source 2D SPH solver implementation for graphics devices, is developed. It is optimized for simulations that must be executed with thousands of frames per second to be computed in reasonable time. A novel caching algorithm for Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) shared memory is proposed and implemented. The software is validated and the performance is evaluated for the well established dambreak test case.

	Abstract = {Local radial basis function-based differential quadrature method is presented in detail in this paper. The method is a natural mesh-free approach. Like the conventional differential quadrature (DQ) method, it discretizes any derivative at a knot by a weighted linear sum of functional values at its neighbouring knots, which may be distributed randomly. However, different from the conventional DQ method, the weighting coefficients in present method are determined by taking the radial basis functions (RBFs) instead of high order polynomials as the test functions. The method works in a similar fashion as conventional finite difference schemes but with "truly" mesh-free property. In this paper, we mainly concentrate on the multiquadric RBFs since they have exponential convergence. The effects of shape parameter c on the accuracy of numerical solution of linear and nonlinear partial differential equations are studied, and how the value of optimal c varies with the number of local support knots is also numerically demonstrated. The proposed method is validated by its application to the simulation of natural convection in a square cavity. Excellent numerical results are obtained on an irregular knot distribution. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

For an efficient implementation it is important that the interaction between the patches themselves, and between the patches and the boundary, is well understood and easily accessible during runtime of the program. We will show that an octree representation of the domain with a tetrahedral mesh at the boundary is an efficient means to provide the needed information. It subdivides an arbitrary domain into simply shaped topological objects (cubes, tetrahedrons) giving a non-overlapping discrete representation of the domain on which efficient numerical integration schemes can be employed. The octants serve as the basic unit to construct the overlapping partitions. The structure of the octree allows the efficient determination of patch interactions.},

A method based on mesh grading propagation which automatically produces a triangular mesh in a multiply connected planar region is presented in this paper. Its core part is an algorithm for triangulating convex polygons. Making use of the shrinking polygons of a convex polygon and the mesh grading propagation rules, the algorithm automatically propagates boundary gradings into the interior of the region and generates meshes whose elements are close to the equilateral triangle in linear time, meanwhile sizes of elements between dense meshes and sparse meshes vary smoothly. The algorithm is incorporated with domain decomposition techniques to generate satisfactory quasi-uniform meshes for 2D arbitrary domains. Experiment results show that its running time is linear with both the number of nodes and the number of elements when generating meshes of different mesh densities for the same arbitrary domain.

	Abstract = {A porous solid may be characterized as an elastic-viscoelastic and acoustic-viscoacoustic medium. For a flexible, open cell porous foam, the transport of energy is carried both through the sound pressure waves propagating through the fluid in the pores, and through the elastic stress waves carried through the solid frame of the material. For a given situation, the balance between energy dissipated through vibration of the solid frame, changes in the acoustic pressure and the coupling between the waves varies with the topological arrangement, choice of material properties, interfacial conditions, etc. Engineering of foams, i.e. designs built on systematic and continuous relationships between polymer chemistry, processing, micro-structure, is still a vision for the future. However, using state-of-the-art simulation techniques, multiple layer arrangements of foams may be tuned to provide acoustic and vibrational damping at a low-weight penalty. In this paper, Biot's modelling of porous foams is briefly reviewed from an acoustics and vibrations perspective with a focus on the energy dissipation mechanisms. Engineered foams will be discussed in terms of results from simulations performed using finite element solutions. A layered vehicle-type structure is used as an example.},

	Abstract = {This paper is devoted to the numerical study of the influence of the non-associativity of the Drucker--Prager model on the plastic limit load and the failure mechanism of the strip footings. The attention is mainly focused on the determination (estimation) of the mechanical fields and geometric characteristics of the collapse mechanism. Rough and smooth contact between the punch and the substrate are considered. Analyses were performed by incremental finite element simulations by using of the object oriented computer code Cast3m. The code is first validated against analytical solutions for two problems available in the literature. It is worth noting that during this validation, we provide new numerical results concerning the ultimate load of a pressurised pore with non-associate matrix. Then, the limit plastic load of the weightless soil is computed and the post-treatment of the numerical results permits one to select the relevant mechanical fields. The main result is that, for the Prandtl mechanism associ...},

	Abstract = {The simulation of large deformation problems, involving complex history-dependent constitutive laws, is of paramount importance in several engineering fields. Particular attention has to be paid to the choice of a suitable numerical technique such that reliable results can be obtained. In this paper, a Material Point Method (MPM) and a Galerkin Meshfree Method (GMM) are presented and verified against classical benchmarks in solid mechanics. The aim is to demonstrate the good behavior of the methods in the simulation of cohesive-frictional materials, both in static and dynamic regimes and in problems dealing with large deformations. The vast majority of MPM techniques in the literatrue are based on some sort of explicit time integration. The techniques proposed in the current work, on the contrary, are based on implicit approaches, which can also be easily adapted to the simulation of static cases. The two methods are presented so as to highlight the similarities to rather than the differences from "standard" Updated Lagrangian (UL) approaches commonly employed by the Finite Elements (FE) community. Although both methods are able to give a good prediction, it is observed that, under very large deformation of the medium, GMM lacks robustness due to its meshfree natrue, which makes the definition of the meshless shape functions more difficult and expensive than in MPM. On the other hand, the mesh-based MPM is demonstrated to be more robust and reliable for extremely large deformation cases.},

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer-Verlag Wien 2016.Landslides can occur in different environments and can interact with or fall into water reservoirs or open sea with different characteristics. The subaerial evolution and the transition from subaerial to subaqueous conditions can strongly control the landslide evolution and the generated impulse waves, and consequently the final hazard zonation. We intend to model the landslide spreading, the impact with the water surface and the generation of the impulse wave under different 2D and 3D conditions and settings. We verify the capabilities of a fully 2D and 3D FEM ALE approach to model and analyse near-field evolution. To this aim we validate the code against 2D laboratory experiments for different Froude number conditions (Fr = 1.4, 3.2). Then the Vajont rockslide (Fr = 0.26--0.75) and the consequent impulse wave are simulated in 2D and 3D. The sliding mass is simulated as an elasto-plastic Mohr--Coulomb material and the lake water as a fully inviscid low compressibility fluid. The rockslide model is validated against field observations, including the total duration, the profile and internal geometry of the final deposit, the maximum water run-up on the opposite valley flank and on the rockslide mass. 2D models are presented for both the case of a dry valley and that of the impounded lake. The set of fully 3D simulations are the first ones available and considering the rockslide evolution, propagation and interaction with the water reservoir. Advantages and disadvantages of the modelling approach are discussed.},

@article{Gritton2017,
	Abstract = {The material point method (MPM) has been very successful in providing solutions to many challenging problems involving large deformations. Nevertheless there are some important issues that remain to be resolved with regard to its analysis. One key challenge applies to both MPM and particle-in-cell (PIC) methods and arises from the difference between the number of particles and the number of the nodal grid points to which the particles are mapped. This difference between the number of particles and the number of grid points gives rise to a non-trivial null space of the linear operator that maps particle values onto nodal grid point values. In other words, there are non-zero particle values that when mapped to the grid point nodes result in a zero value there. Moreover, when the nodal values at the grid points are mapped back to particles, part of those particle values may be in that same null space. Given positive mapping weights from particles to nodes such null space values are oscillatory in nature. While this problem has been observed almost since the beginning of PIC methods there are still elements of it that are problematical today as well as methods that transcend it. The null space may be viewed as being connected to the ringing instability identified by Brackbill for PIC methods. It will be shown that it is possible to remove these null space values from the solution using a null space filter. This filter improves the accuracy of the MPM methods using an approach that is based upon a local singular value decomposition (SVD) calculation. This local SVD approach is compared against the global SVD approach previously considered by the authors and to a recent MPM method by Zhang and colleagues.},

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. In implicit solvation models, the electrostatic contribution to the solvation energy can be estimated by solving a system of elliptic partial differential equations modeling the reaction potential. The domain of definition of such elliptic equations is the union of the van derWaals cavities corresponding to the atoms of the solute molecule. Therefore, the computations can naturally be performed using Schwarz methods, where each atom of the molecule corresponds to a subdomain. In contrast to classical Schwarz theory, it was observed numerically that the convergence of the Schwarz method in this case does not depend on the number of subdomains, even without coarse correction. We prove this observation by analyzing the Schwarz iteration matrices in Fourier space and evaluating corresponding norms in a simplified setting. In order to obtain our contraction results, we had to choose a specific iteration formulation, and we show that other formulations of the same algorithm can generate Schwarz iteration matrices with much larger norms leading to the failure of norm arguments, even though the spectral radii are identical. By introducing a new optimality concept for Schwarz iteration operators with respect to error estimation, we finally show how to find Schwarz iteration matrix formulations which permit such small norm estimates.},

	Abstract = {The modelling of geomechanics problems can require a method that allows large deformations and non-linear material behaviour, in this respect the Generalised Material Point Method (GIMPM) is ideal. A fully implicit version of GIMPM has recently been developed for geomechanics problems and some aspects of its implementation are described here. An area that has received less attention in material point methods is that conventional analysis techniques constructed in terms of stress and strain are unable to resolve structural instabilities such as shear banding. This is because they do not contain any measure of the length of the microstructure of the material analysed, such as molecule size or grain structure. Gradient theories provide extensions of the classical equations with additional higher-order terms. The use of length scales makes it possible to model a finite thickness shear band which is not possible with traditional methods. Much work has been done on using gradient theories to include the effect of microstructure in the finite element method (and other numerical analysis techniques) however this yet to be combined with material point methods. In this paper the key equations that are required to extend the implicit GIMPM method to include gradient elasto-plasticity are detailed.},

First, a family of second-order schemes in time is analyzed. A priori estimates for displacements in discrete energy norms are obtained and the corresponding convergence results are proved. Numerical examples are given to illustrate the convergence properties of these methods. As in the case of an incompressible fluid and small permeability, these schemes suffer from spurious oscillations in time, a first order scheme is proposed and analyzed. For this new scheme a priori estimates and convergence results are also given.

	Abstract = {This thesis is devoted to the numerical analysis of mesh-free methods and, in particular, to the study of the possible advantages of the EFG (Element Free Galerkin) mesh-free method against the well-known FE (Finite Element) method. More precisely, the EFG method and the FE method behavior are compared in two particular interesting problems: (1) analysis of volumetric locking in mechanical problems and (2) accurate resolution of transient convection dominated problems. In both cases the good properties and possibilities of mesh-free methods become apparent. However, in several situations the FE method is still more competitive: for instance, the computation of the FE shape functions and its integrals are less costly, and essential boundary conditions can be easily imposed. Thus, in order to take advantage of the good properties of both methods, a mixed interpolation combining FE and EFG is proposed. This formulation can be applied in two useful situations: (i) enrichment of finite elements with EFG, and (ii) coupling of FE and EFG. An a priori error estimate for the first one is presented and proved. Several examples show the applicability of the mixed interpolation in adaptive computations.},

The material point method (MPM) enhanced with B-spline basis functions, referred to as B-spline MPM (BSMPM), is developed and demonstrated using representative quasi-static and dynamic example problems. Smooth B-spline basis functions could significantly reduce the cell-crossing error as known for the original MPM. A Gauss quadrature scheme is designed and shown to be able to diminish the quadrature error in the BSMPM analysis of large-deformation problems for the improved accuracy and convergence, especially with the quadratic B-splines. Moreover, the increase in the order of the B-spline basis function is also found to be an effective way to reduce the quadrature error and to improve accuracy and convergence. For plate impact examples, it is demonstrated that the BSMPM outperforms the generalized interpolation material point (GIMP) and convected particle domain interpolation (CPDI) methods in term of the accuracy of representing stress waves. Thus, the BSMPM could become a promising alternative to the MPM, GIMP, and CPDI in solving certain types of transient problems.},

	Abstract = {Contact between bodies is one of the most challenging problems to solve, especially when combined with large deformations. For MPM, several methods have been developed to simulate frictional contact, i.e. shear stress is proportional to the normal stress via a friction coefficient; however, for cohesive soils under undrained conditions the interface shear stress is more likely a function of the undrained shear strength and independent of the normal stress (adhesive contact). This paper presents the extension of one of the most widely used contact algorithms in MPM for adhesive contact. This enhanced formulation is validated with a sliding block benchmark and applied to the simulation of cone penetration testing (CPT) in clay. CPT is an in situ test commonly used in geoengineering to determine the subsoil's stratigraphy and to estimate soil parameters. It is shown that the adhesion at the cone-soil interface affects significantly the measured cone resistance. Numerical results are compared with available analytical and experimental studies, showing the effectiveness of the proposed method to describe undrained penetration in clay.},

The integral formulation, based on the fundamental solution of Biot's poroelastic theory, eliminates the need for domain discretization for piecewise homogeneous media and automatically satisfies the radiation conditions. Additionally, there is no special treatment required for the incompressibilty that may result under undrained conditions. The axisymmetric formulation that is developed offers further reduction in dimensionality of the problem and provides a convenient framework for investigating the behavior of circular foundations. The BEM algorithm is validated via comparisons with an analytical solution for the dynamic response of a soil column under uniaxial loading and is then utilized to study the dynamic compliance of a shallow circular foundation. The suitability of employing various quasistatic and elastodynamic idealizations is considered in some detail.},

Here the mathematical model is discretized by the finite element method. First, the stress update scheme was formulated, the tangent matrix is explicitly derived and then the non-linear system is solved by the NewtonRaphson method where a new algorithm using a symmetrical tangent matrix is improved. This is in opposition to conventional non-associated plasticity, which uses a non-symmetric tangent matrix. Through the numerical examples we show the feasibility and the efficiency of the algorithm.

	Abstract = {Most finite element packages use the Newmark algorithm for time integration of structural dynamics. Various algorithms have been proposed to better optimize the high frequency dissipation of this algorithm. Hulbert and Chung proposed both implicit and explicit forms of the generalized alpha method. The algorithms optimize high frequency dissipation effectively, and despite recent work on algorithms that possess momentum conserving=energy dissipative properties in a non-linear context, the generalized alpha method remains an effcient way to solve many problems, especially with adaptive timestep control. However, the implicit and explicit algorithms use incompatible parameter sets and cannot be used together in a spatial partition, whereas this can be done for the Newmark algorithm, as Hughes and Liu demonstrated, and for the HHT-alpha algorithm developed from it. The present paper shows that the explicit generalized alpha method can be rewritten so that it becomes compatible with the implicit form. All four algorithmic parameters can be matched between the explicit and implicit forms. An element interface between implicit and explicit partitions can then be used, analogous to that devised by Hughes and Liu to extend the Newmark method. The stability of the explicit=implicit algorithm is examined in a linear context and found to exceed that of the explicit partition. The element partition is significantly less dissipative of intermediate frequencies than one using the HHT-alpha method. The explicit algorithm can also be rewritten so that the discrete equation of motion evaluates forces from displacements and velocities found at the predicted mid-point of a cycle.},

Recently, MPM has been successfully applied in many engineering applications including solid and solid--fluid interaction problems due to its capability to model complex history dependent material behaviours. However, the conventional explicit MPM approach exhibits numerical limitations in incompressible or near incompressible material behaviour problems. We study an implicit treatment of the pressure in MPM algorithm to simulate material incompressibility avoiding artificial pressure oscillations and significantly small time steps present in the explicit MPM approach. Applying Chorin's projection method to the velocity--pressure coupled equations, an elliptic equation is solved for the pressure which is then used to solve the divergence free velocity field. The results of dam break problem show no spurious pressure oscillations and large time steps compared to the traditional explicit MPM. The ability of the present implicit MPM formulation to model incompressible materials will be an additional advantage in simulating materials with complex constitutive equations which exhibit a time dependent memory.},

	Abstract = {The study developed in this thesis is focused on numerical modeling of dynamics behavior of dry soils in the framework of small and large deformation theory and of dynamics behavior of saturated soils in the framework of small deformation theory. A numerical code has been developed to analyze such behaviors and presents three versions: - The Runge-Kutta Taylor-SPH for analysis of dry soils behavior in dynamic (small deformation theory) - The new Runge-Kutta Taylor-SPH for analysis of dry soils behavior in dynamic (large deformation theory) - The v - pw Runge-Kutta Taylor-SPH for analysis of saturated soils behavior in dynamic (small deformation theory) Both of them are based on a mathematical model which describes the dynamic of viscoplastic solids. The governing equations of the mathematical model behind the Runge-Kutta Taylor-SPH and the new Runge-Kutta Taylor-SPH are: i) the balance of momentum equation, ii) the constitutive equation and iii) the kinetic relation. The mathematical model used to describe the dynamics behavior of saturated soil is based on the u - pw model of Zienkiewicz and his team. This model represents the behavior of the mixture of solid particles and pore water. It is based on the following governing equations: i) the mass balance equations of the solid phase, of the pore water and of the mixture, ii) the momentum balance equations of the solid phase, of the pore water and of the mixture, iii) the constitutive equation and iv) the kinetic relation. In the thesis we used the Perzyna?s model as the constitutive equation. It is a simple viscoplastic model. This constitutive equation is completed by the Von Mises yield criterion or the yield surface of the modified Cam-Clay model depending on the problem studied. The mathematical model is formulated in terms of velocity and stress for the dry soils behavior and in terms of velocity, effective stress and pore water pressure for the saturated soils behavior. This formulation avoids the shortcomings of the classical formulation of solid dynamics. The numerical tool to discretize the equations of the mathematical model is the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics method (SPH). This work presents the theory and the limitations of this method. The classical SPH method presents a tensile instability when it is applied to solids. In the different versions of the Runge-Kutta Taylor-SPH model, the equations of the mathematical model are first discretized in time using the Taylor-Galerkin method. In a second step the equations are discretized in space with the SPH method. The mixing between the SPH method and the Taylor-Galerkin method allows avoiding the development of the SPH tensile instability and in consequence, the new model can be used for solids modeling. The numerical code proposed in this work has been tested with 17 case studies. The results obtained with the numerical code have been compared to analytical solutions when it was possible. The results show that the proposed numerical models are accurate and useful to predict localized failures of dry and saturated soils.

Las ecuaciones del modelo matem�tico en el cual se basan el modelo Runge-Kutta Taylor-SPH y el ?nuevo? modelo Runge-Kutta Taylor-SPH son: i) la ecuaci�n de balance del momento lineal, ii) la ecuaci�n constitutiva y iii) la relaci�n cin�tica. El modelo matem�tico utilizado para describir el comportamiento din�mico de los suelos saturados viene del modelo u - pw introducido por Zienkiewicz y su equipo. Este modelo representa el comportamiento de la mezcla de part�culas solidas con agua intersticial. Est� basado en las ecuaciones siguientes: i) las ecuaciones de balance de masa de la fase solida, del agua intersticial y de la mezcla, ii) las ecuaciones de balance del momento lineal de la fase solida, del agua intersticial y de la mezcla, iii) la ecuaci�n constitutiva y iv) la relaci�n cin�tica. En este trabajo la ecuaci�n constitutiva elegida es el modelo viscopl�stico de Perzyna. La ecuaci�n constitutiva est� completada por el criterio de fluencia de Von Mises o por la superficie de fluencia del modelo Cam-Clay modificada seg�n el problema estudiado. El modelo matem�tico est� formulado en velocidades y tensiones para el comportamiento de los suelos secos y en velocidades, tensiones efectivas y presi�n intersticial para los suelos saturados. Esta formulaci�n elimina los defectos de la formulaci�n cl�sica de la din�mica de s�lidos. La herramienta num�rica para discretizar las ecuaciones del modelo matem�tico es el m�todo Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH). Este trabajo presenta la teor�a y las limitaciones de este m�todo. El m�todo cl�sico SPH presenta una inestabilidad de tensi�n cuando se aplica a s�lidos. En las varias versionas del modelo Runge-Kutta Taylor-SPH, las ecuaciones del modelo matem�tico se discretizan en el tiempo bas�ndose en el m�todo Taylor-Galerkin. En una segunda etapa las ecuaciones se discretizan en el espacio con el m�todo SPH. La mezcla entre el SPH cl�sico y el m�todo Taylor-Galerkin permite evitar el desarrollo de la inestabilidad de tensi�n y en consecuencia el nuevo modelo se puede utilizar para modelizar el comportamiento dinamico de s�lidos. El c�digo num�rico propuesto en esta tesis ha sido probado con 17 casos. Los resultados obtenidos han sido comparados con soluciones anal�ticas cuando era posible y han mostrado que el modelo Runge-Kutta Taylor-SPH es exacto y es �til para predecir roturas localizadas en suelos secos y saturados.},

The numerical procedures and the implementation to nonlinear finite element programs are presented. Mooney-Rivlin, Cubic, and Modified Cubic strain energy density functions are used in the numerical examples. Several classical finite elasticity problems as well as some practical engineering elastomer problems are analyzed. The need to account for the slight compressibility of rubber (finite bulk modulus) in the finite element formulation is demonstrated in the study of apparent Young's modulus of bonded thin rubber units. The combined shear-bending deformation that commonly exists in rubber mounting systems is also analyzed and discussed. {\textcopyright} 1996 ASME.},

@article{Chiaruttini1996,
	Abstract = {A two-dimensional elastic Chebyshev spectral element method (SPEM) is used to model the seismic wavefield within a massive structure and in its vicinity. We consider 2-D models where a linear elastic structure, with quadrangular cross-section, resting on an elastic homogeneous half-space, is impinged upon by the waves generated by a surface impulse at some distance. The scattering of Rayleigh waves and the response of the structure are extensively analysed in a parametric way, varying size, mechanical parameters and shape of the load. Some of the models considered are representative of embankments and earth dams. The simulation shows that some models resonate, storing part of the incoming energy. With realistic parameters, the lowest resonance frequency is due to pure shear deformation and is controlled by the shear velocity and height of the load. Flexural modes are excited only at higher frequencies. The acceleration at the top of the structure may be five/seven times higher than at the base, depending on the mass of the structure. The gradual release of trapped energy produces a ground roll lasting several seconds after the wave front has passed. The ground-roll amplitude depends on the sturcture's mass and can be as large as 30{\%} of the peak acceleration. Outside resonance conditions, the ground motion is almost unaffected by the presence of the artefact; the horizontal motion on top of it is nearly twice the motion at ground level. Similar results should be expected when the incident field is an upcoming shear wave. A qualitative discussion shows that the presence of anelastic attenuation in the embankment does not significantly alter the preceding conclusions, unless it is of very low values (e.g. Q {\textless} 15). The modelling results that we discuss indicate that the soil-structure interaction may substantially alter the 'free-field' ground motion. From a practical point of view, the main conclusions are: (1) careful analysis is necessary when interpreting seismic records collected in the vicinity of large artefacts; (2) seismic hazard at a site may depend on the presence of man-made structures such as embankments, dams, tall and massive buildings.},

	Abstract = {This paper discusses some aspects of the finite element prediction of damage growth and fracture initiation in finitely deforming ductile solids. The material presented is of particular relevance to the simulation of industrial metal forming operations characterised by the presence of extreme deformations and strains, often resulting in localised material deterioration with possible fracture nucleation and growth. In this context, we focus on the crucial issues of constitutive modelling, low order finite element technology for near-incompressibility and adaptive mesh refinement. Constitutive modelling is treated within the framework of continuum damage mechanics. The effect of micro-crack closure, which may dramatically decrease the rate of damage growth under compression, is incorporated and its computational implementation is discussed. The use of low order elements in the presence of high nearly-isochoric plastic strains is addressed with the introduction of a methodology whereby the volumetric constraint is enforced over patches of simplex elements. This allows the effective use of simplex tetrahedra - for which intricate contact conditions as well as mesh generation over complex evolving geometries can be easily treated - without the volumetric locking typically associated with conventional low order displacement-based elements. With the aim of achieving an effective and robust adaptive strategy for this class of problems, it is important to design a damage-based error indicator which represents the essential features of the physical phenomena under consideration. The underlying idea is to correlate the adaptive procedure with the failure mechanism. The effectiveness of the resulting framework is demonstrated by the solution of relevant problems. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {This paper proposes a hydro-geomechanical finite element model to reproduce the kinematic behaviour of large slow landslides. The interaction between solid skeleton and pore fluids is modelled with a time dependent u--p w formulation and a groundwater model that takes into account recorded daily rainfall intensity. A viscoplastic constitutive model based on Perzyna's theory is applied to reproduce soil viscous behaviour and the delayed creep deformation. The proposed model is applied to Portalet landslide (Central Spanish Pyrenees). This is an active paleo-landslide that has been reactivated by the construction of a parking area at the toe of the slope. The stability analysis reveals that, after the constructive solutions were undertaken, the slope is in a limit equilibrium situation. Nevertheless, time-dependent analysis reproduces the nearly constant strain rate (secondary creep) and the acceleration/deceleration of the moving mass due to hydrological changes. Overall, the model reproduces a 2-m displacement in the past 8 years that coincides with in situ monitoring data. The proposed model is useful for short- and mid-term predictions of secondary creep. However, long-time predictions remain uncertain, stability depends strongly on the position of the water table depth and new failures during tertiary creep due to soil temporal microstructural degradation are difficult to calibrate.},

Two approaches based on the variations of (1) elastic modulus (E) and (2) strain rate ($\epsilon$̇), were used. Results from both approaches indicated that the damage to concrete at peak load depended mainly on the rate of loading, as it increased with increasing loading rate. The specimens subjected to impact loading were found to suffer higher damage than those subjected to static loading, as seen by the larger value of D at peak load (0.8-0.9 for concrete subjected to impact loading and 0.65 for concrete subjected to static loading). Beyond the peak, the strain energy was sufficient to cause the damage to increase to one (D=1) without any further applied load. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

This theory assumes that particles in a continuum interact with each other across a finite distance, as in molecular dynamics. Damage is incorporated in the theory at the level of these two-particle interactions, so localization and fracture occur as a natural outgrowth of the equation of motion and constitutive models. A numerical method for solving dynamic problems within the peridynamic theory is described. Accuracy and numerical stability are discussed.

	Abstract = {Geomaterials in general, and soils in particular, are highly nonlinear materials presenting a very strong coupling between solid skeleton and intersticial water. In the limit of zero compressibility of water and soil grains and zero permeability (which correspond to the classical 'undrained' assumption of Soil Mechanics), the functions used to interpolate displacements and pressures must fulfill either the Babuska-Brezzi conditions or the much simpler patch test proposed by Zienkiewicz and Taylor. These requirements exclude the use of elements with equal order interpolation for pressures and displacements, for which spurious oscillations may appear. The simplest elements with continuous pressures which can be used in 2D are the quadratic triangle and quadrilateral with linear and bilinear pressures, respectively. The purpose of this paper is to present a stabilization technique allowing the use of both linear triangles for displacements and pressures (T3P3) and bilinear quadrilaterals (Q4P4). The proposed element will be applied to obtain limit loads and failure surfaces in simple boundary value problems for which analytical solutions exist.},

This process$\backslash$nof combining Lagrangian and Eulerian features is standard in MPM;$\backslash$nthe modification for membranes involves merely an implementation$\backslash$nof the constitutive equation in a local, normal-tangential coordinate$\backslash$nsystem.

@article{Pastor1997,
	Abstract = {Finite elements used for analysis of plastic failure must admit near incompressible behaviour for meaningful results whenever the plastic flow rule is isochoric. Most of the classical elements based on displacement formulations present problems to a greater or lesser extent when obtaining limit loads and failure mechanisms. Mixed pressure-displacement formulations are a suitable alternative, but not every combination of interpolation functions for pressures and displacements is allowed, since they have to satisfy Babuska-Brezzi conditions or pass a patch test for convergence. This excludes interpolations of the same order for both fields unless special techniques are used. This paper describes the formulation of mixed displacement-pressure elements with the same order of interpolation, and presents application to elastic and contained viscoplastic failure problems. It is shown how such different elements, like the T3P3 (linear displacements and pressures triangle) or the T6P6 (quadratic triangle in both variables), avoid volumetric locking and circumvent above mentioned restrictions. Indeed the formulation allows arbitrary interpolations as all restrictions are removed. However, the proposed formulation does not improve other aspects of element behaviour such as bending, and, therefore, the linear triangle is not recommended. Finally, performance of the quadratic T6P6 triangle is assessed using boundary value problems for which analytical solutions are available. Robustness against distortion is checked, and a good overall performance of this element is found},

	Abstract = {This paper extends the local fracture energy concept of Hu and Wittmann [29,30], and proposes a bilinear model for boundary or size effect on the fracture properties of cementitious materials. The bilinear function used to approximate the non-constant local fracture energy distribution along a ligament is based on the assumption of the proportionality of the local fracture energy to the fracture process zone (FPZ) height and characterises the FPZ height reduction when approaching a specimen back boundary. The bilinear function consists of a horizontal straight line of the intrinsic fracture energy GF and a declining straight line that reduces to zero at the back boundary. It is demonstrated that using the bilinear model, the size-independent fracture energy GF can be estimated from the fracture energy data measured on laboratory-size specimens, and the intersection of these two linear functions, defined as the transition ligament, represents the influence of the back boundary on the fracture properties. It is also demonstrated that the specimen size alone is not sufficient to characterise the size effect in the fracture properties observed on laboratory-size specimens. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Ltd.

	Abstract = {The compressional wave of the second kind which was predicted theoretically by Biot (1956a) was observed in granular soils using very sensitive transducers. The Biot theory models both the individual and coupled behaviour of soil skeleton and pore fluid using the permeability, porosity, viscosity, densities and appropriate elastic constants of the solid, pore fluid and solid skeleton. The measured Biotwave velocities agree well with the theoretical values computed using properties and parameters which were obtained primarily from laboratory tests. The good agreement demonstrates that the Biot theory is valid for granular soils. The propagation of the P- and S-waves in granular materials was measured under different confining pressures and in both dry and saturated conditions. An empirical relationship between shear modulus G (in kPa) and confining pressure sigma (sub c) (in kPa) for Monterey sand and crystal silica sand samples was found to be given by G = 1.10(sigma (sub c) ) (super 0.42) X1.64(sigma (sub c) ) (super 0.46) . The measured Poisson's ratio of the soil skeleton is in the range 0.323-0.418, and it decreases as the confining pressure increases. The results of theoretical studies of the effect of frequency on wave velocities and the influences of other parameters are also presented.},

The elastic moduli typically vary as power functions of the mean stress. Simple models of this non- linearity can result in behaviour that violates the laws of thermodynamics. To guarantee that an elasticity model is thermodynamically acceptable it must be possible to derive the elastic behaviour from a free energy potential (or alternatively from a complementary energy potential). In this paper elasticity models are derived that allow for variation of elastic moduli as power functions of mean stress, while guaranteeing thermodynamic acceptability. The important issue of the dependence of secant stiffness on strain amplitude (a phenomenon related to dissipation processes in the soil) is acknowledged but not addressed here.},

abstract = {The material point method (MPM) has been increasingly used for the simulation of large-deformation processes in fluid-infiltrated porous materials. For undrained poromechanical problems, however, standard MPMs are numerically unstable because they use low-order interpolation functions that violate the inf–sup stability condition. In this work, we develop stabilized MPM formulations for dynamic and quasi-static poromechanics that permit the use of standard low-order interpolation functions notwithstanding the drainage condition. For the stabilization of both dynamic and quasi-static formulations, we utilize the polynomial pressure projection method whereby a stabilization term is augmented to the balance of mass. The stabilization term can be implemented with both the original and generalized interpolation material point (GIMP) methods, and it is compatible with existing time-integration methods. Here we use fully-implicit methods for both dynamic and quasi-static poromechanical problems, aided by a block-preconditioned Newton–Krylov solver. The stabilized MPMs are verified and investigated through several numerical examples under dynamic and quasi-static conditions. Results show that the proposed MPM formulations allow standard low-order interpolation functions to be used for both the solid displacement and pore pressure fields of poromechanical formulations, from undrained to drained conditions, and from dynamic to quasi-static conditions.}

abstract = {Based on the u-p form governing equations and the convected particle domain interpolation technique, the improved convected particle domain interpolation based material point method (CCPDI) is developed in this paper for the coupled dynamic and contact analysis of fully saturated porous media involving large deformation. The numerical artifact noises due to material points crossing computational grid boundaries that usually occur in large deformation are eliminated by using the smoother interpolation functions presented in the convected particle domain interpolation technique. The discrete equations are derived in the framework of the generalized interpolation material point method. The boundary load tracking algorithm and a modified contact algorithm are proposed based on the definition of particle domains to apply accurately the surface loads on the motive boundaries and to capture correctly the contact time/behaviors in large deformation problems, respectively. Simulations of several representative one- and two-dimensional problems are presented to demonstrate the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods. Compared to those obtained by using the coupling material point method and/or finite element method, the simulation results illustrate that the proposed CCPDI method can be successfully used in simulating the large deformation coupled dynamic responses of the solid skeleton and fluid phase in fully saturated porous media and the large deformation impact between solid and saturated porous bodies.}

abstract = {Material Point Method (MPM) has arisen in the recent years as an alternative to Finite Element Method (FEM) under large deformations. However, the simulation of shock waves propagation in the large deformation regime is still challenging under this approach due to the incapability of the standard MPM time integration scheme to filter spurious noises. To overcome it, we propose in this paper an explicit Predictor–Corrector time integration scheme. Its powerful performance mitigates the presence of spurious oscillations with minimal dissipation in high frequency problems. Other source of numerical noise in MPM occurs when the material points cross computational grid boundaries, being caused by the lack of smoothness of the interpolation functions. This noise results in spurious local variations at the material points, where strain–stress fields are computed. This could lead to inaccurate solutions as well as aborted simulations in the worst cases. To surmount it, we propose in this work the Local Maximum-Entropy (LME) approximation schemes as a robust substitute of the traditional shape function in MPM. The performance of both improvements is validated by the high quality results of the numerical examples.}

The contact/impact problem between saturated porous media and solid bodies, like soil–structure interaction, is solved under the framework of the MPM. In the proposed strategy, the dynamic analysis of saturated soil and solid bodies is handled by the CMPM and the original MPM respectively. The interaction between saturated soil and solid bodies is simulated by a new contact algorithm which effectively avoids the interpenetration between saturated soil and solid bodies. The proposed approach circumvents the difficulties associated with the conventional spatial discretization methods such as the finite element method in simulating the contact/impact behavior between saturated soil and solid bodies. Representative examples are used to verify the proposed model-based simulation procedure and to demonstrate its potential in impact analysis related to geotechnical engineering.}

An implicit time integration scheme is herein developed within the framework of the u--w (solid displacement--relative fluid displacement) formulation for the Biot's equations. In particular, liquid water saturated porous media is considered and the linearization of the linear momentum equations taking into account all the inertia terms for both solid and fluid phases is for the first time presented. The spatial discretization is carried out through a meshfree method, in which the shape functions are based on the principle of local maximum entropy LME. The current methodology is firstly validated with the dynamic consolidation of a soil column and the plastic shear band formulation of a square domain loaded by a rigid footing. The feasibility of this new numerical approach for solving large deformation dynamic problems is finally demonstrated through the application to an embankment problem subjected to an earthquake. {\textcopyright} 2017, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	Abstract = {The aim of this thesis is to apply and improve the material-point method for modelling of geotechnical problems. One of the geotechnical phenomena that is a subject of active research is the study of landslides. A large amount of research is focused on determining when slopes become unstable. Hence, it is possible to predict if a certain slope is stable using commercial finite element or finite difference software such as PLAXIS, ABAQUS or FLAC. However, the dynamics during a landslide are less explored. The material-point method (MPM) is a novel numerical method aimed at analysing prob- lems involving materials subjected to large strains in a dynamical time--space domain. This thesis explores the material-point method with the specific aim of improving the performance for geotechnical problems. Large-strain geotechnical problems such as landslides pose a major challenge to model numerically. Employing material points to track all relevant variables and a computational grid to solve the equations of motion, the material-point method avoids some of the problematic issues associated with traditional numerical models such as the finite element method. However, several challenges for the method exist as discussed in this thesis. The thesis discusses the state of the art of the material-point method. Further, it presents ideas to better represent problems involving extreme deformations utilizing the framework of the generalized interpolation material point method (GIMP). Some of the results of this thesis are presented in the form of three research papers. The content of the individual papers are summarised below.},

Here, a model is presented based on the so-called generalised-interpolation material-point method, combining a Eulerian grid for solving the governing equations of a continuum with a Lagrangian description for the material. The method is extended to analyse interaction between multiple bodies, introducing a master-slave algorithm for frictional contact along interfaces. Further, a deformed material description is introduced, based on time integration of the deformation gradient and utilising Gauss quadrature over the volume associated with each material point. The method has been implemented in a Fortran code and employed for the analysis of a landslide that took place during the night of December 1st, 2008, near L{\o}nstrup, Denmark. Using a simple Mohr-Coulomb model for the soil, the computational model is able to reproduce the change in the slope geometry at the site.},

@article{Mises,
	Abstract = {Desde los albores del desarrollo de las leyes matem{\'{a}}ticas, en la Mec{\'{a}}nica del suelo, se ha usado la ley de Hooke para describir la respuesta de materiales granulares sometidos a cargas externas. En realidad, la relaci{\'{o}}n tensi{\'{o}}n-deformaci{\'{o}}n de los suelos granulares es no lineal, inel{\'{a}}stica, anis{\'{o}}tropa, y no homog{\'{e}}nea. Adem{\'{a}}s, el comportamiento de este tipo de suelos depende del tiempo y de la trayecto-ria seguida por la tensi{\'{o}}n. Debido a esto, para describir de una forma m{\'{a}}s realista el comportamiento inel{\'{a}}stico de los suelos se necesitan leyes constitutivas m{\'{a}}s sofisticadas . Para poder predecir este comportamiento tan complejo de los suelos granulares, se puede acudir a la teor{\'{i}}a cl{\'{a}}sica de la plasticidad, la cual nos proporciona una estructura global con la que abordar el problema. Bajo la hip{\'{o}}tesis de aplicaci{\'{o}}n infinitesimal de las cargas, el comportamiento del suelo es independiente del tiempo. Esta independencia puede formularse con la teor{\'{i}}a cl{\'{a}}sica de la plasticidad como una combinaci{\'{o}}n de comportamiento el{\'{a}}stico y pl{\'{a}}stico. Ya que no hay una correspondencia biun{\'{i}}voca entre la tensi{\'{o}}n y deformaci{\'{o}}n en el estado pl{\'{a}}stico, no es posible obtener una relaci{\'{o}}n tensi{\'{o}}n-deformaci{\'{o}}n {\'{u}}nicamente en t{\'{e}}rminos del estado tensional actual. Por esta raz{\'{o}}n, en la teor{\'{i}}a de la plasticidad, la relaci{\'{o}}n incremental en t{\'{e}}rminos de incrementos de tensi{\'{o}}n y deformaci{\'{o}}n debe expresarse mediante el historial de tensiones y deformaciones que soporta el suelo. Desde que se plante{\'{o}} el criterio de plastificaci{\'{o}}n de Von Mises para plasticidad en metales, se han desarrollado una gran cantidad de modelos. A ra{\'{i}}z de la dependencia de la tensi{\'{o}}n principal en el modelo de Von Mises, se desarroll{\'{o}} el modelo Drucker-Prager para modelar materiales is{\'{o}}tropos (Drucker, 1951[8]). Posteriormente, se propuso la teor{\'{i}}a de estados cr{\'{i}}ticos, que asume la existencia de una {\'{u}}nica superficie en p 0 − q − e (tensi{\'{o}}n efectiva principal, tensi{\'{o}}n tangencial e {\'{i}}ndice de huecos). Esta teor{\'{i}}a propici{\'{o}} grandes avances en el campo de la plasticidad de los suelos. Entre los modelos desarrollados m{\'{a}}s {\'{u}}tiles para suelos se encuentra el modelo Cam-Clay (Roscoe et al., 1968[22]; Schofield y Wroth, 1968[24]; Roscoe y Burland, 1968[21]) que fue el primer modelo de plasticidad de suelos que estableci{\'{o}} una conexi{\'{o}}n entre la deformaci{\'{o}}n volum{\'{e}}trica $\epsilon$ v y las caracter{\'{i}}sticas de resistencia a cortante de suelos normalmente consolidados. Este modelo fue la base para muchas formulaciones matem{\'{a}}ticas del comportamiento del suelo. Aunque estos modelos fueron v{\'{a}}lidos durante mucho tiempo, la complejidad del comportamien-to real de materiales granulares hizo que se desarrollaran una gran variedad de modelos pl{\'{a}}sticos macrosc{\'{o}}picos. Aspectos que se tuvieron en cuenta en estos modelos fueron: la dilatancia y el com-portamiento a cargas c{\'{i}}clicas de suelos sueltos. Estos fen{\'{o}}menos son propios de los terremotos que provocan asientos en suelos tipo arenas o liquefacci{\'{o}}n en suelos saturados sueltos. Para este tipo de casos, el modelo Cam-Clay ya no es apropiado ya que se basa en una relaci{\'{o}}n {\'{u}}nica entre el tama{\~{n}}o de la superficie de plastificaci{\'{o}}n y la deformaci{\'{o}}n volum{\'{e}}trica, excluyendo la posibilidad de dilataci{\'{o}}n de materiales densos. Otra hip{\'{o}}tesis en la que se basa este modelo es la plasticidad cl{\'{a}}sica, la cual es-tablece que existe una separaci{\'{o}}n clara entre el comportamiento pl{\'{a}}stico y el el{\'{a}}stico. Esta suposici{\'{o}}n incurre en grandes errores en la predicci{\'{o}}n de la presi{\'{o}}n intersticial y deformaciones el{\'{a}}sticas irreales 31 32 Cap{\'{i}}tulo 3. Plasticidad y formulaci{\'{o}}n constitutiva del modelo Cam-Clay durante la descarga en la aplicaci{\'{o}}n de cargas c{\'{i}}clicas infinitesimales. Para resolver estos problemas se han desarrollado modelos que incluyen los siguientes conceptos: 1. M{\'{u}}ltiples superficies de plastificaci{\'{o}}n anidadas presentado por Mroz (1967)[17] y usado m{\'{a}}s tarde por Iwan (1967)[11]. 2. Mecanismos m{\'{u}}ltiples de plastificaci{\'{o}}n y leyes de flujo no asociativas presentado por Koiter (1953)[13] y usado m{\'{a}}s tarde por Lade (1977)[14]. 3. Plastificaci{\'{o}}n progresiva desde un estado de tensi{\'{o}}n hasta una superfice l{\'{i}}mite presentado por Dafalias y Popov (1976)[6]. Fue usado m{\'{a}}s tarde por Borja et al. (2001)[4]. Los modelos con superficies de plastificaci{\'{o}}n anidadas, resuelven la incapacidad de la plasticidad cl{\'{a}}sica para modelar el comportamiento anisotr{\'{o}}po, cuando se aplican cargas c{\'{i}}clicas. En estos mod-elos, se definen una serie de superficies anidadas que pueden desplazarse y crecer mientras se produce la carga pl{\'{a}}stica. Los incrementos de deformaci{\'{o}}n pl{\'{a}}stica se obtienen por la contribuci{\'{o}}n individual de cada mecanismo de plastificaci{\'{o}}n. El concepto de superficie l{\'{i}}mite presentado por Dafalias y Popov (1976)[6] abandona la idea de superficie de plastificaci{\'{o}}n; en cambio, usa un estado imagen sobre la superficie l{\'{i}}mite para determinar el comportamiento del suelo en la zona pl{\'{a}}stica. Para obtener el m{\'{o}}dulo pl{\'{a}}stico se usa una expresi{\'{o}}n que relaciona el estado de tensi{\'{o}}n con un estado imagen sobre la superficie l{\'{i}}mite. Como acabamos de ver, la capacidad de los modelos constitutivos para suelos ha aumentado, pero esto ha llevado consigo un incremento de la complejidad de los mismos. As{\'{i}}, podemos concluir que no es nada sencillo caracterizar de forma apropiada los materiales mediante los modelos constitutivos presentados e implementarlos usando el metodo de los elementos finitos. Por lo tanto, se plantea la b{\'{u}}squeda de un modelo no muy complejo, con una formulaci{\'{o}}n matem{\'{a}}tica robusta, pero sin desviarse excesivamente del comportamiento real del suelo. 3.2.

Biot's consolidation theory, extended to include irreversible phenomena is considered and the direct boundary element technique is used for the numerical solution after time discretization by the implicit Euler backward algorithm. The associated nonlinear algebraic problem is solved by the Newton-Raphson procedure whereby the loading/unloading conditions are fully taken into account and the consistent tangent operator defined. Only domain nodes (nodes defined inside the domain) are used to represent all domain values and the corresponding integrals are computed by using an accurate sub-elementation scheme.

We describe strategies to achieve prescribed accuracy on an optimal mesh by using a posteriori error estimators. We also demonstrate how element size distribution of the optimal mesh can be accurately predicted. The use of such refinement strategies in the adaptive h-refinement and adaptive hp-refinement always leads to the optimal rate of convergence of the finite element approximation. When integrated with automatic mesh generators, the prescribed accuracy can be achieved with minimum computational cost.},

	Abstract = {Finite element simulations of coupled solid-deformation/fluid-diffusion occurring in earthquake fault zones often require high-fidelity descriptions of the spatial and temporal variations of excess pore water pressure. Large-scale calculation of the coupled fault zone process is often inhibited by the high-order interpolation of the displacement field required to overcome unstable tendencies of the finite elements in the incompressible and nearly incompressible limit. In this work we utilize a stabilized formulation in which the balance of mass is augmented with an additional term representing a stabilization to the incremental change in the pressure field. The stabilized formulation permits equal-order interpolation for the displacement and pore pressure fields and suppresses pore pressure oscillations in the incompressible and nearly incompressible limit. The technique is implemented with a recently developed critical state plasticity model to investigate transient fluid-flow/solid-deformation processes arising from slip weakening of a fault segment. The accompanying transient pore pressure development and dissipation can be used to predict fault rupture and directivity where fluid flow is an important driving force. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

	Abstract = {A model for granular materials is presented that describes both the internal deformation of each granule and the interactions between grains. The model, which is based on the FLIP-material point, particle-in-cell method, solves continuum constutitive models for each grain. Interactions between grains are calculated with a contact algorithm that forbids interpenetration, but allows separation and sliding and rolling with friction. The particle-in-cell method eliminates the need for a separate contact detection step. The use of a common rest frame in the contact model yields a linear scaling of the computational cost with the number of grains. The properties of the model are illustrated by numerical solutions of sliding and rolling contacts, and for granular materials by a shear calculation. The results of numerical calculations demonstrate that contacts are modeled accurately for smooth granules whose shape is resolved by the computations mesh.},

These equations give the displacement vector in both the solid and fluid phases in terms of surface tractions and displacements, as well as in terms of any non-zero initial conditions and body forces. The fundamental solutions for instantaneous point body forces acting in each of the two phases are found in closed form by exploiting the use of four scalar potentials that reduce the problem to two decoupled second-order systems in the Laplace transformed domain. Finally, a parallel is drawn between dynamic poroelasticity and dynamic thermoelasticity by discovering analogies between the variables and material constants of each case.},

Most of these are over‐complex for realistic parameter identification and have not been widely adopted for practical use. In this paper we introduce a relatively simple modification of the well‐known critical state model which accounts reasonably well for the phenomena observed under cyclic tests and indeed improves the performance of critical state, models in monotonic loading. This model is compared with experimental results and with the `densification model' introduced earlier by the authors and shows good predicitive capacity. The model is of a generalized plasticity‐bounding surface type. In its simplest form, suitable for clay‐like materials, it requires the identifications of a single parameter additional to those required for a standard, critical state model.

It is shown that, unlike the results in classical small strain theory, the average degree of consolidation defined by stress (i.e. Up) and that defined by strain (i.e. Us) in large strain theory are different. The magnitude of settlement predicted by large strain theory is found to be smaller while both the development of settlement and the dissipation of excess pore water pressure (as shown by Us and Up) are found to be faster than in small strain consolidation in the cases studied. Another interesting observation is that the discrepancy between large and small strain theories diminishes with reducing compressibility (i.e. increasing stiffness) of soil and decreasing magnitude of applied load. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {The transient surface flow occurring when a cylindrical pile of dry granular material is suddenly allowed to spread on a horizontal plane is investigated experimentally as a function of the released mass M, the initial aspect ratio a of the granular cylinder pile, the properties of the underlying substrate smooth or rough, rigid or erodible and the bead size. Two different flow regimes leading to three different deposit morphologies are observed as a function of the initial aspect ratio a, whatever the substrate properties and the bead size. For a3, the granular mass spreads through an avalanche on its flanks producing either truncated cone or conical deposits. For a3, the upper part of the column descends conserving its shape while the foot of the pile propagates radially outward. The obtained deposit looks like a ``Mexican hat'' and the slope angle at the foot of the deposit is observed to saturate at a value of the order of 5$\,^{\circ}$. For a given ground and bead size, the flow dynamics and the deposit morphology are found to be independent of M and to vary only with the initial aspect ratio a. Further investigation indicates that the deposit morphology depends only slightly on the substrate properties and the bead size, except when a becomes large. In particular the same dynamical regimes and deposit morphologies are recovered for the same range of a, independent of the substrate properties or the bead size. Moreover the rescaled deposit radius, the rescaled spreading velocity, and the fraction of energy dissipated during the flow do not depend on M, the substrate properties, or the bead size, but vary only with a.We believe this to be the signature of the fact that the flow develops near the free surface of the granular pile so that the dynamics is essentially controlled by grain/grain interactions.},

	Abstract = {The stability of a dense granular assembly can be greatly reduced by a pore pressure of the interstitial fluid, and the body may fail and transit from a solid-like state to a fluid-like state. This process involves two major problems: large deformation and hydro-mechanical coupling. In this work, a three-dimensional fully coupled hydro-mechanical model using material point method (MPM) is developed. Darcy's law, considering the inertial effect, is adopted to govern the motion of interstitial water, and the conservation of momentum of the mixture is used to govern the motion of the solid, i.e., granular materials. The spatial discretization schemes for these equations are derived using the generalized integration material point method (GIMP), and the proposed coupled MPM formulation is implemented in a three-dimensional numerical code. The developed model is first quantitatively validated by comparing the simulation results of temporal evolution of spatial distribution of hydraulic pressure in a one-dimensional oedometer test with the analytical results. An experiment is designed to observe the failure of a saturated sand pile, in which the partial-saturated region is avoided by increasing the hydraulic head at the input boundary, and the kinetic energy of water is dissipated by a filtering cloth. The failure process is simulated with the MPM code. It is found that the location of the shear band in the simulation agrees with the location of the sliding surface in the experiment. The temporal evolutions of the spatial distributions of hydraulic pressure and the solid velocity distribution at a specific time are given to provide insight into the mechanism of the failure process. This work would be helpful in understanding the initiation mechanism of debris flows induced by rainfall, and sand production in gas hydrate-bearing sediments due to increasing fluid content associated with hydrate dissociation.},

For that purpose, in an explicit finite element code, the X-FEM with only discontinuous enrichment is used coupled with level sets to represent the crack geometry. We show on a complex example that the commonly used Hamilton-Jacobi based level set updating algorithm lacks robustness and numerical efficiency to model such types of problems. To circumvent this, we introduce a simple geometric updating algorithm that does not involve any equation solving, and is therefore numerically cheap. The robustness of this updating algorithm is demonstrated on several virtual propagation examples. Finally common benchmark used in the literature as well as a complex experiment involving the dynamic propagation of a non-planar 3D crack under impact loading are used to demonstrate the efficiency of the approach.},

	Abstract = {Landslides can cause major economic damage and a large number of casualties as it is possible to see from past events occurred all over the world. Being able to predict these kind of hazards would then suppose the achievement of great benefits. Here a model that combines a depth integrated description of the soil-pore fluid mixture together with a set of 1D models dealing with pore pressure evolution within the soil mass is presented. The mathematical model is based on the Biot-Zienkiewicz equations, from where a depth averaged model is derived. Concerning the material behaviour, the approach used is the one suggested by the Perzyna viscoplasticity, which has been extensively used in the past to model solid behaviour prior to failure. In this framework, a simple shear rheological model is derived, providing the basal friction needed in depth integrated models. The Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) has been the numerical technique chosen to spatially discretised the depth integrated equations of the mathematical model. The purpose of this work is to apply the SPH depth integrated numerical model, together with the sub-model that predicts the evolution of the pore water pressure inside the landslide, to simulate the propagation phase of the Aberfan flowslide occurred in 1966.},

Indeed such problems are nearly incompressible which implies that volumetric behavior is negligible compared to deviatoric ones. The application of a mixed formulation for such problems can avoid the difficulties and is of great practical interest as nearly incompressible behavior is encountered in a variety of real engineering problems ranging from soil mechanics to aerospace engineering. Identical problems also arise when the flow of incompressible fluids is encountered. This chapter presents methods that can be applied to both fully incompressible problems (Poisson ratio equal to one-half) as well as nearly incompressible problems. Assessment of various element formulations is first made using the mixed patch test presented in the previous chapter. Later, however, it is shown how other elements also can be treated using so-called stabilize procedures.},

	Abstract = {The material point method (MPM) is an evolution of the particle in cell method where Lagrangian particles or material points are used to discretize the volume of a material. The particles carry properties such as mass, velocity, stress, and strain and move through an Eulerian or spatial mesh. The momentum equation is solved on the Eulerian mesh. Modifications to the material point method are developed that allow the simulation of thin membranes, compressible fluids, and their dynamic interactions. A single layer of material points through the thickness is used to represent a membrane. The constitutive equation for the membrane is applied in the local coordinate system of each material point. Validation problems are presented and numerical convergence is demonstrated. Fluid simulation is achieved by implementing a constitutive equation for a compressible, viscous, Newtonian fluid and by solution of the energy equation. The fluid formulation is validated by simulating a traveling shock wave in a compressible fluid. Interactions of the fluid and membrane are handled naturally with the method. The fluid and membrane communicate through the Eulerian grid on which forces are calculated due to the fluid and membrane stress states. Validation problems include simulating a projectile impacting an inflated airbag. In some impact simulations with the MPM, bodies may tend to ``stick'' together when separating. Several algorithms are proposed and tested that allow bodies to separate from each other after impact. In addition, several methods are investigated to determine the local coordinate system of a membrane material point without relying upon connectivity data.},

	Abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 OWZ The material point method (MPM) has proved to be an effective particle method for computational mechanics modeling of problems involving contact, but all prior applications have been limited to Coulomb friction. This paper generalizes the MPM approach for contact to handle any friction law with examples given for friction with adhesion or with a velocity-dependent coefficient of friction. Accounting for adhesion requires an extra calculation to evaluate contact area. Implementation of velocity-dependent laws usually needs numerical methods to find contacting forces. The friction process involves work which can be converted into heat. This paper provides a new method for calculating frictional heating that accounts for interfacial acceleration during the time step. The acceleration terms is small for many problems, but temporal convergence of heating effects for problems involving vibrations and high contact forces is improved by the new method. Fortunately, the new method needs few extra calculations and therefore is recommended for all simulations.},

	Abstract = {We present a displacement-based Galerkin meshfree method for the analysis of nearly-incompressible linear elastic solids, where low-order simplicial tessellations (i.e., 3-node triangular or 4-node tetrahedral meshes) are used as a background structure for numerical integration of the weak form integrals and to get the nodal information for the computation of the meshfree basis functions. In this approach, a volume-averaged nodal projection operator is constructed to project the dilatational strain into an approximation space of equal- or lower-order than the approximation space for the displacement field resulting in a locking-free method. The stability of the method is provided via bubble-like basis functions. Because the notion of an 'element' or 'cell' is not present in the computation of the meshfree basis functions such low-order tessellations can be used regardless of the order of the approximation spaces desired. First- and second-order meshfree basis functions are chosen as a particular case in the proposed method. Numerical examples are provided in two and three dimensions to demonstrate the robustness of the method, its ability to avoid volumetric locking in the nearly-incompressible regime, and its improved performance when compared to the MINI finite element scheme on the simplicial mesh.},

The proposed stability conditions simplify to the existing ones of the CH method for the one-phase formulation when the solid-fluid coupling is ignored. Furthermore, by degrading the CH method to the Newmark method, the stability conditions are in agreement with the ones proposed in previous stability investigations on coupled formulation for the Newmark method. The analytically derived stability conditions are validated with finite element (FE) analyses considering a range of loading conditions and for various soil permeability values, showing that the numerical results are in agreement with the theoretical investigation. Then, the stability characteristics of the CH method are explored beyond the limits of the theoretical investigation, assuming elasto-plastic soil behaviour which is prescribed with a bounding surface plasticity constitutive model. Since the CH method is a generalisation of a number of other time integration methods, the derived stability conditions are relevant for most of the commonly utilised time integration methods for the two-phase coupled formulation.},

The Disuete Element Method (DEM) is used for disrete modelling and the Material-Point Method (MPM) fo, continuum modelling. MPM is a so-called particle method or meshless fi-nite element method. Standard finite element meth-ods have dfficulty in modelling the complete dis-charge process unless remeshing is employed. The use of meshless methods overcomes this problem. Experiments are performed using a two-dimensional rectangular silo. Corn grains and ssnd are used as materials. A calibration process is proposed to de-termine the micro material properties needed for DEM simulations. The calibration process is based on experimental and numerical direct shear and compressions tests. Granular materials often exhibit rotational degrees of freedom associated with couple moments. To account for the rotation, the Cosserat polar continuum is used with MPM. DEM and MPM simulations are performed and the results of flow patterns and flow rates compared to experi-ments. It is concluded that both DEM and MPM can successfuUy model the total discharge process in terms of flow patterns and flow rates. A time study shows that if a relatively small number of particles are used in a DEM model, the computing times are comparable to that of MPM.},

In addition, in order to accurately simulate the complete creep response of cohesive soils, including creep rupture, a microstructure-based damage law is presented and incorporated into the time-dependent model. The model is numerically implemented and simulations of undrained creep response for both isotropically and anisotropically consolidated soils are provided. The model predictions compared favorably with experimental results, and soil anisotropy has been found to have a significant effect on the undrained creep behavior of anisotropic cohesive soils. The damage law has demonstrated excellent potential for simulating the entire undrained creep response including rupture.},

MPM is a so- called meshless method capable of modelling large displacements, deformations and contact between different bodies. A short introduction to MPM is given and the derivation of the discrete governing equations. The analysis of a vertically loaded anchor and one loaded at 458 is presented. The load-- displacement curves are compared to that obtained from experiments and the effect of soil stiffness and anchor roughness is investigated. The results of the vertically loaded anchor are also compared to an analytical solution. The displacement of the soil surface above the anchor was measured and compared to the numerical predictions. Convergence with mesh refinement is demonstrated and the effect of mesh size and dilatancy angle on the shear band width and orientation is indicated. The results show that MPM can model anchor pull out successfully. No special interface elements are needed to model the anchor--soil interface and the predicted ultimate capacities were within 10{\%} of the measured values.},

@article{Lajeunesse2005,
	Abstract = {We report the results of an experimental investigation of the flow induced by the collapse of a column of granular material (glass beads of diameter d) over a horizontal surface. Two different setups are used, namely, a rectangular channel and a semicircular tube, allowing us to compare two-dimensional and axisymmetric flows, with particular focus on the internal flow structure. In both geometries the flow dynamics and the deposit morphologies are observed to depend primarily on the initial aspect ratio of the granular column a=Hi /Li, where Hi is the height of the initial granular column and Li its length along the flow direction. Two distinct regimes are observed depending on a: an avalanche of the column flanks producing truncated deposits for small a and a column free fall leading to conical deposits for large a. In both geometries the characteristic time scale is the free fall of the granular column tau{\{}{\_}{\}}c=sqrt(H{\{}{\_}{\}}i /g). The flow initiated by Coulomb-like failure never involves the whole granular heap but remains localized in a surface layer whose size and shape depend on a and vary in both space and time. Except in the vicinity of the pile foot where the flow is pluglike, velocity profiles measured at the side wall are identical to those commonly observed in steady granular surface flows: the velocity varies linearly with depth in the flowing layer and decreases exponentially with depth in the static layer. Moreover, the shear rate is constant, gamma dot=0.3sqrt(g/d), independent of the initial aspect ratio, the flow geometry, position along the heap, or ˙ time. Despite the rather complex flow dynamics, the scaled deposit height Hf /Li and runout distance Delta L/Li both exhibit simple power laws whose exponents depend on a and on the flow geometry.We show that the physical origin of these power laws can be understood on the basis of a dynamic balance between acceleration, pressure gradient, and friction forces at the foot of the granular pile. Two asymptotic behaviors can be distinguished: the flow is dominated by friction forces at small a and by pressure forces at large a. The effect of the flow geometry is determined primarily by mass conservation and becomes important only for large a.},

	Abstract = {A framework is presented within which the method of augmented Lagrangians is readily applied to problems involving contact with friction. This method, which has enjoyed considerable success in the treatment of constrained minimization problems, has been previously applied to problems involving incompressible flow, incompressible elasticity of solids and even frictionless contact. An additional challenge to the method is provided by frictional contact problems governed by a Coulomb law, due to the special form taken by the frictional constraint. This paper describes a new extension of the augmented Lagrangian technique to frictional problems which is well-suited to finite element implementation. The proposed treatment inherits the traditional advantages of augmented Lagrangian techniques over penalty methods; namely, decreased ill-conditioning of governing equations, and essentially exact satisfaction of constraints with finite penalties. A set of numerical examples is presented in which the utility of the method is demonstrated even in the presence of finite deformations and inelasticity. {\textcopyright} 1991.},

	Abstract = {An application of smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulation of soil-water interaction is presented. In this calculation, water is modeled as a viscous fluid with week compressibility and soil is modeled as an elastic-perfectly plastic material. The Mohr-Coulomb failure criterion is applied to describe the stress states of soil in the plastic flow regime. Dry soil is modeled by one-phase flow while saturated soil is modeled by separate water and soil phases. Interaction between soil and water is taken into account by means of pore water pressure and seepage force. Simulation tests of soil excavation by a water jet are calculated as a challenging example to verify the broad applicability of the SPH method. The excavations are carried out in two different soil models, one is dry soil and the other is fully saturated soil. Numerical results obtained in this paper have shown that the gross discontinuities of soil failure can be simulated without any difficulties. This supports the feasibility and attractiveness of this a new approach in geomechanics applications. Advantages of the method are robustness, conceptual simplicity and relative ease of incorporating new physics. {\textcopyright} 2007 ISTVS.},

	Abstract = {An assumed-strain finite element technique is presented for linear, elastic small-deformation models. Weighted residual method (reminiscent of the strain--displacement functional) is used to weakly enforce the balance equation with the natural boundary condition and the kinematic equation (the strain--displacement relationship). A priori satisfaction of the kinematic weighted residual serves as a condition from which strain--displacement operators are derived via nodal integration. A variety of element shapes is treated: linear triangles, quadrilaterals, tetrahedra, hexahedra, and quadratic (six-node) triangles and (27-node) hexahedra. The degrees of freedom are only the primitive variables (displacements at the nodes). The formulation allows for general anisotropic materials. A straightforward constraint count can partially explain the insensitivity of the resulting finite element models to locking in the incompressible limit. Furthermore, the numerical inf--sup test is applied in select problems and several variants of the proposed formulations (linear triangles, quadrilaterals, tetrahedra, hexahedra, and 27-node hexahedra) pass the test. Examples are used to illustrate the performance with respect to sensitivity to shape distortion and the ability to resist volumetric locking.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents an enhanced version of the elasto-plastic model for partially saturated soil first proposed by Bolzon, Schrefler and Zienkiewicz in 1996, "BSZ" model, which uses the effective stress tensor and suction as independent stress variables. It is recalled that the effective stress tensor proposed by Lewis and Schrefler in 1982 is thermodynamically consistent and, compared with other choices of stress tensors, results particularly suitable for partially saturated soil mechanics. A hydraulic constitutive relationship and a hydraulic hysteresis are introduced in the model, to take into account the irreversible deformation during cyclic drying and wetting until structural collapse. For this reason the plastic rate of strain is split into the sum of two components: one depending on the effective stress tensor and the other one on suction. This is the new feature of the BSZ model. This enhanced model is then cast into a thermodynamical framework at macroscopic level and it is shown that it is possible to derive the constitutive law from the Helmholtz free energy and a dissipation function, both for associative and non- associative plasticity. Finally the model predictions have been compared with experimental data for Sion slime, with particular emphasis on the deviatoric part, and model predictions of hysteretic behaviour have been investigated in case of a wetting and drying cycle on compacted betonite-kaolin.},

First, we develop an eigensoftening algorithm to capture the gradual process of failure in materials with a softening behavior as an extension of the eigenerosion approach. Both methods are validated against the physical measurements in three-point bending tests of concrete with a drop-weight device, including impact and reaction forces, loading-line displacements as well as strain histories from gauges. The comparison shows that the eigenerosion algorithm significantly overestimates the tensile stresses and the strain peaks, while it captures the forces and crack pattern accurately. Predictions made by the proposed eigensoftening algorithm agree very well with experimental results in all aspects. Second, the energy evolution and partition in the beam predicted by the eigensoftening algorithm at various impact rates is analyzed to quantify the rate dependent fracture properties of concrete. It is demonstrated that, at impact loading conditions, the area below the reaction-deflection curve is much larger than the dissipated fracture energy.},

	Abstract = {Installation effects in geotechnical engineering contains the proceedings of the International Conference on Installation Effects in Geotechnical Engineering (Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 24-27 March 2013), the closing conference of GEO-INSTALL (FP7/2007-2013, PIAG-GA-2009-230638), an Industry-Academia Pathways and Partnerships project funded by the European Community from the 7th Framework Programme. Infrastructure construction involves the installation of structural elements, such as piles and various ground improvement techniques for soils and rocks. The installation process itself can be quasi-static (for example jacked piles) or dynamic (vibratory methods, such as stone columns and driven piles), and generally involves very large deformations and changes in pore pressure. The fact that natural soils are complex geomaterials, exhibiting structure and rate-dependent behaviour, makes analysis of such problems yet more challenging. In particular, the influence of installation on key design parameters, such as mobilised strength at the soilstructure interface and soil stiffness, is difficult to quantify and, as yet, impossible to model. Numerical analyses using the standard Finite Element Method (FEM) are unable to produce accurate descriptions of large deformation problems due to excessive mesh distortions and novel techniques need to be developed. Installation effects in geotechnical engineering presents the latest developments in monitoring, analysing and managing installation effects in geotechnical engineering, and covers aspects ranging from large deformation modelling to real field applications. Topics include: computational methods, constitutive modelling, installation effects, offshore constructions and foundations, soil improvement, and soil-structure interaction. The book is aimed at academics, researchers and practitioners in geotechnical engineering and geomechanics, and at practicing civil engineers.},

	Abstract = {The purpose of this work is twofold. First, we demonstrate analyt-ically that the classical Newmark family as well as related integration algorithms are variational in the sense of the Veselov formulation of discrete mechanics. Such variational algorithms are well known to be symplectic and momentum preserving and to often have excellent global energy behavior. This analytical result is verified through numerical ex-amples and is believed to be one of the primary reasons that this class of algorithms performs so well. Second, we develop algorithms for mechanical systems with forcing, and in particular, for dissipative systems. In this case, we develop inte-grators that are based on a discretization of the Lagrange d'Alembert principle as well as on a variational formulation of dissipation. It is demonstrated that these types of structured integrators have good nu-merical behavior in terms of obtaining the correct amounts by which the energy changes over the integration run.},

The system is defined by components we call elements which are joined together at discrete points we call nodes. Today, discrete problems can generally be solved using computers even if the number of elements is very large. Systems which are continuous are often defined using differential equations or equivalent statements which imply an infinite number of elements. Engineering solutions to continuous problems can be attained using discretization methods. This volume presents a view of the finite element method as a general discretization procedure of continuous systems. Finite element analyses follow a standard pattern which is universally adaptable to all discrete systems. The goal of this volume is to show how finite element methods lead to a standard discrete system. This chapter is primarily concerned with establishing the processes applicable to such systems.},

In order to deal with high material deformation, an implicit Material Point Method is chosen. Such choice allows avoiding the classical limitations of the Finite Element Method, e.g., element tangling and extreme mesh distortion. The proposed mixed formulation, with displacement and pressure as primary variables, is tested through classical benchmarks in solid and geo-mechanics where a Neo-Hookean, a J2 and a Mohr-Coulomb plastic law are employed. Further, the stabilized mixed formulation is compared with a displacement-based formulation to demonstrate how the proposed approach gets better results in terms of accuracy, not only when incompressible materials are simulated, but also in the case of compressible ones.},

It simply needs one additional input parameter compared to the Soft-Soil model. Therefore the performance of these two models can be compared relatively easily. The first embankment considered is the well-known Boston trial embankment. For this embankment, however, measurements of settlements and hor-izontal displacements have not been continued long enough to include secondary compression. Consequently, for the second 2D FE-analysis an embankment with a long period of secondary settlements has been considered. This is an embankment from the Sk{\aa} Edeby test site in Sweden.},

The proposed approach is validated using a series of benchmark examples from both solid and fluid mechanics, demonstrating the broad range of modeling possibilities within the MPM framework when combined with appropriate anti-locking techniques and algorithms.},

However, in the large deformation regime, the CPDI still may not retain the expected convergence rate. The paper proposes an enhanced CPDI formulation based on least square reconstruction technique. The convected particle least square interpolation (CPLS) material point method assumes the velocity field inside the material point domain as nonconstant. This velocity field in the material point domain is mapped to the background grid nodes with a moving least squares reconstruction. In this paper, we apply the improved moving least squares method to avoid the instability of the conventional moving least squares method due to a singular matrix.

	Abstract = {The soil is characterized by the influence of the hydrostatic stress, which leads to a yield surface with a shape of a pyramid for MohrCoulomb criteria and a shape of a cone for DruckerPrager one. These materials are also characterized by a non-associated plasticity where the plastic yielding rule does not follow the normality rule. The usual mechanical models use two independent functions to describe this particular collapse. Unfortunately, this manner broke the model formulation. The purpose of this work is to present a consistent formulation of the non-associated plasticity of soil. The frame of the mathematical analysis is the concept of the implicit standard material. The cornerstone of this new idea is the construction of a single function called the bipotential playing in the same time the roles of the yield surface and the plastic potential. The bipotential concept is then intended to involve the constitutive law, cover the normality rule even for the non-associated soil and the proof of the solution existence. The formulation was initially performed for the case of a regular point out of the cone apex and in present, it is extended to the irregular point located at the apex. The paper presents firstly the implicit standard material method. Then, the methodology to build a full model for the boundary value problem is detailed. Particular expressions and relations are sufficiently explained and discussed. Attention is made to the evolution problem and the variational principles related to the elasticplastic behavior. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Using the particle data, Lagrangian moment equations are solved on a grid. The solutions are then used to advance the particle variables from time step to time step. An adaptive grid and implicit time differencing extend the method to multiple time and space scale flows. Aspects of FLIP's properties are illustrated by modeling of a confined eddy, a Rayleigh-Taylor, an unstable subsonic stream, and a supersonic jet.

	Abstract = {Particle Methods are those in which the problem is represented by a discrete number of particles. Eachparticle moves accordingly with its own mass and the external/internal forces applied to it. ParticleMethods may be used for both, discrete and continuous problems. In this paper, a Particle Methodis used to solve the continuous fluid mechanics equations. To evaluate the external applied forces oneach particle, the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations using a Lagrangian formulation are solvedat each time step. The interpolation functions are those used in the Meshless Finite Element Methodand the time integration is introduced by an implicit fractional-step method. In this manner classicalstabilization terms used in the momentum equations are unnecessary due to lack of convective termsin the Lagrangian formulation. Once the forces are evaluated, the particles move independently ofthe mesh. All the information is transmitted by the particles. Fluid--structure interaction problemsincluding free-fluid-surfaces, breaking waves and fluid particle separation may be easily solved withthis methodology.

@article{Dvorkin1993,
	Abstract = {The velocities and attenuation of seismic and acoustic waves in rocks with fluids are affected by the two most important modes of fluid/solid interaction: (1) the Biot mechanism where the fluid is forced to participate in the solid's motion by viscous friction and inertial coupling, and (2) the squirt-flow mechanism where the fluid is squeezed out of thin pores deformed by a passing wave. Traditionally, both modes have been modeled sepa- rately, with the Biot mechanism treated in a macroscopic framework, and the squirt flow examined at the individ- ual pore level. We offer a model which treats both mechanisms as coupled processes and relates P-velocity and attenuation to macroscopic parameters: the Biot poroelastic constants, porosity, permeability, fluid compressibility and viscosity, and a newly introduced micro- scale parameter-a characteristic squirt-flow length. The latter is referred to as a fundamental rock property that can be determined experimentally. We show that the squirt-flow mechanism dominates the Biot mechanism and is responsible for measured large velocity disper- sion and attenuation values. The model directly relates P-velocity and attenuation to measurable rock and fluid properties. Therefore, it allows one to realisti- cally interpret velocity dispersion and/or attenuation in terms of fluid properties changes [e.g., viscosity during thermal enhanced oil recovery (EOR)], or to link seismic measurements to reservoir properties. As an example of the latter transformation, we relate permeability to attenuation and achieve good qualita- tive correlation with experimental data. INTRODUCTION},

	Abstract = {The Material Point Method (MPM) has shown itself to be a powerful tool in the simulation of large deformation problems, especially those involving complex geometries and contact where typical finite element type methods frequently fail. While these large complex problems lead to some impressive simulations and solutions, there has been a lack of basic analysis characterizing the errors present in the method, even on the simplest of problems. The large number of choices one has when implementing the method, such as the choice of basis functions and boundary treatments, further complicates this error analysis. In this paper we explore some of the many choices one can make when implementing an MPM algorithm and the numerical ramifications of these choices. Specifically, we analyze and demonstrate how the smoothing length within the Generalized Interpolation Material Point Method (GIMP) can affect the error and stability properties of the method. We also demonstrate how various choices of basis functions and boundary treatments affect the spatial convergence properties of MPM.},

To test the completeness of the solution scheme and to demonstrate certain features of the MPM, a one-dimensional MPM code is programmed to solve one-dimensional wave and impact problems, with both linear elasticity and elastoplasticity models. The advantages and disadvantages of the MPM are investigated as compared with competing mesh-free methods. Based on the current work, future research directions are discussed to better simulate complex physical problems such as impact/contact, localization, crack propagation, penetration, perforation, fragmentation, and interactions among different material phases.

	Abstract = {The numerical simulation of a consolidation process undergoing large strains is a challenging task that requires the formulation and the solution of the coupled soliddeformation/ fluid-diffusion problem within a changing geometry. Deformations can be rigorously taken into account with the classical Finite Element Method (FEM) based on continuum mechanics of porous media at finite strains. Alternatively, several innovative methods (SPH, MPM, PFEM, MLPG, etc.), which have been specifically developed to simulate large deformations, can be used. Among them, the Material Point Method (MPM) has been recently grown in popularity. With the MPM, large deformations are simulated with material points (MP) moving through a fixed mesh. The MP trace all the properties of the continuum (mass, velocity, stress, strain as well as external loads), while the mesh is used to solve the governing equations, but does not store any permanent information thus it can be redefined at the end of each time step, preventing problems of element distortions. The aim of this work is to investigate the analogies and the differences in terms of theoretical formulation and numerical results between FEM and MPM in consolidation processes undergoing large deformations. In fact, the simulations of the one-dimensional consolidation process in case of small deformations demonstrate that the two methods give identical results, which are also in agreement with the analytical solution demonstrated by Terzaghi. On the contrary, differences are observed in the case of large deformations. The results obtained with the two formulations are compared and discussed, enlightening the most probable source of differences.},

	Abstract = {Predicting plastic deformation and localization band around a wellbore drilled through a porous rock is a challenging task that could have important implications for the prediction of instability and sand production. This study focuses on analyzing stress field, plastic zones, and localized deformations around a horizontal borehole drilled at a great depth through a highly porous rock formation. Several laboratory studies demonstrate that, depending on the loading path, highly porous rocks are susceptible to different failure mechanisms, but most of these mechanisms are mainly due to shear-induced dilation and shear-enhanced compaction. Plasticity models, in conjunction with bifurcation analysis, represent an extremely useful framework for describing such detailed constitutive responses. This paper presents a new elastoplastic constitutive model characterized by two yield surfaces intersecting smoothly, that is able to capture the different failure modes. The model is validated against experimental data for several different porous rocks, and it is then used to determine the stress and strain distributions around a horizontal wellbore using nonlinear finite element analysis. Particular interest is devoted to predicting the condition for the formation of a localized band of intense deformation, elucidating the factors that either prevent or enhance the band initiation. Results of simulations show the key role played by the elastoplastic constitutive model and the effects of the mud pressure, the in-situ stress condition and geometric imperfections in the development and propagation of plastic zone, as well as in the initiation of localization zone.},

@book{Owen:08,
	Abstract = {Two integration algorithms, namely the implicit return mapping and explicit sub-stepping schemes, are adopted in the anisotropic bounding surface plasticity model for cyclic behaviours of saturated clay and are implemented into finite element code. The model is a representative of a series of bounding surface models that have typical characteristics, including isotropic and kinematic hardening rules and a rotational bounding surface to capture complex but important cyclic behaviours of soils, such as cyclic shakedown and degradation. However, there is no explicit current yield surface in the model to which the conventional implicit algorithm returns the stress state back or the sub-stepping integration corrects the drift of the stress state. Hence, necessary modifications have been made for both of the integration schemes. First, the image stress point is mapped or corrected to the bounding surface instead of mapping back or correcting the stress state to the yield surface. Second, the unloading--loading criterion is checked to determine the image stress point rather than checking the yield criterion after giving the trial stress state in a conventional way. Comparative studies on the accuracy, stability and efficiency of the two integration schemes are conducted not only at the element level but also in solving boundary value problems of monotonic and cyclic bearing behaviours of rigid footings on saturated clay. For smaller strain increments, there is no significant difference in the accuracy between the two integration schemes, but the explicit integration shows a higher efficiency and accuracy. For relatively larger increments, the implicit return mapping algorithm presents good accuracy and more robustness, while the sub-stepping algorithm shows deteriorating accuracy and suffers the convergence problem. With the tolerance used in the present model, the bearing capacity of the rigid footing predicted by the return mapping algorithm is closer to the available analytical and numerical solutions, while the bearing capacity predicted by the sub-stepping algorithm shows a marginal increase.},

	Abstract = {Fracture and Size Effect in Concrete and Other Quasibrittle Materials is the first in-depth text on the application of fracture mechanics to the analysis of failure in concrete structures. The book synthesizes a vast number of recent research results in the literature to provide a comprehensive treatment of the topic that does not give merely the facts - it provides true understanding. The many recent results on quasibrittle fracture and size effect, which were scattered throughout many periodicals, are compiled here in a single volume. This book presents a well-rounded discussion of the theory of size effect and scaling of failure loads in structures. The size effect, which is the most important practical manifestation of fracture behavior, has become a hot topic. It has gained prominence in current research on concrete and quasibrittle materials. The treatment of every subject in Fracture and Size Effect in Concrete and Other Quasibrittle Materials proceeds from simple to complex, from specialized to general, and is as concise as possible using the simplest level of mathematics necessary to treat the subject clearly and accurately. Whether you are an engineering student or a practicing engineer, this book provides you with a clear presentation, including full derivations and examples, from which you can gain real understanding of fracture and size effect in concrete and other quasibrittle materials.},

Two kinds of optimization algorithms are used to minimize the error function, the first one based on a gradient method and the second one based on a genetic algorithm.

Finally, it is shown that the use of a genetic algorithm to identify the soil parameters seems particularly suitable when the topology of the error function is complex.},

@article{Sabetamal2014,
	Abstract = {This paper outlines the development as well as implementation of a numerical procedure for coupled finite element analysis of dynamic problems in geomechanics, particularly those involving large deformations and soil-structure interaction. The procedure is based on Biot's theory for the dynamic behaviour of saturated porous media. The nonlinear behaviour of the solid phase of the soil is represented by either the Mohr Coulomb or Modified Cam Clay material model. The interface between soil and structure is modelled by the so-called node-to-segment contact method. The contact algorithm uses a penalty approach to enforce constraints and to prevent rigid body interpenetration. Moreover, the contact algorithm utilises a smooth discretisation of the contact surfaces to decrease numerical oscillations. An Arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) scheme preserves the quality and topology of the finite element mesh throughout the numerical simulation. The generalised-$\alpha$ method is used to integrate the governing equations of motion in the time domain. Some aspects of the numerical procedure are validated by solving two benchmark problems. Subsequently, dynamic soil behaviour including the development of excess pore-water pressure due to the fast installation of a single pile and the penetration of a free falling torpedo anchor are studied. The numerical results indicate the robustness and applicability of the proposed method. Typical distributions of the predicted excess pore-water pressures generated due to the dynamic penetration of an object into a saturated soil are presented, revealing higher magnitudes of pore pressure at the face of the penetrometer and lower values along the shaft. A smooth discretisation of the contact interface between soil and structure is found to be a crucial factor to avoid severe oscillations in the predicted dynamic response of the soil. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

	Abstract = {In the numerical approximation of phase-field models of fracture in porous media with the finite element method, the problem of numerical locking may occur. The causes can be traced both to the hydraulic and to the mechanical properties of the material. In this work we present a mixed finite element formulation for phase-field modeling of brittle fracture in elastic solids based on a volumetric-deviatoric energy split and its extension to water saturated porous media. For the latter, two alternative mixed formulations are proposed. To be able to use finite elements with linear interpolation for all the field variables, which violates the Ladyzenskaja-Babuska-Brezzi condition, a stabilization technique based on polynomial pressure projections, proposed and tested by previous authors in fluid mechanics and poromechanics, is introduced. We develop an extension of this stabilization to phase-field mixed models of brittle fracture in porous media. Several numerical examples are illustrated, to show the occurrence of different locking phenomena and to compare the solutions obtained with different unstable, stable and stabilized low order finite elements.},

@article{Ehlers:99,
	Abstract = {Based on the Theory of Porous Media (TPM), a formulation of a fluid-saturated porous solid is presented where both constituents, the solid and the fluid, are assumed to be materially incompressible. Therefore, the so-called point of compaction exists. This deformation state is reached when all pores are closed and any further volume compression is impossible due to the incompressibility constraint of the solid skeleton material. To describe this effect, a new finite elasticity law is developed on the basis of a hyperelastic strain energy function, thus governing the constraint of material incompressibility for the solid material. Furthermore, a power function to describe deformation dependent permeability effects is introduced. After the spatial discretization of the governing field equations within the finite element method, a differential algebraic system in time arises due to the ineompressibility constraint of both constituents. For the efficient numerical treatment of the strongly coupled nonlinear solid-fluid problem, a consistent linearization of the weak forms of the governing equations with respect to the unknowns must be used.},
